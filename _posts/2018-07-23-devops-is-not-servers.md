I've always assumed that DevOps are the people who work between servers and developers.

That was until I read a novel titled [The Phoenix
Project](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17255186-the-phoenix-project),
recommended to me by [Bartosz Pranczke](https://twitter.com/bpranczke).

Suddenly, all the pieces started to fit, and the software development environment looks different to me. I realised that DevOps is not a function, but a culture.

... and that everyone on the team is responsible for a project's success.

Implementing DevOps around a project is HARD.

So imagine that my current goal is to help the entire organization do that.

I've spent a lot of time recently working closer to the projects, analyzing our development processes and talking with people.

For starters, I would like to define and track KPIs that will help us decide whether weâ€™re headed in the right direction.

Once we know the baseline, we can start improving.

The metrics pick will likely not be ideal, but we need them to build self-assurance, improve, and celebrate progress.

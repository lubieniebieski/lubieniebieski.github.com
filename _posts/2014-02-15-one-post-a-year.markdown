funny thing, I have all the post I've written in 2013 and 2014 next to each other. this site shouldn't even be considered as blog, but I hope this particular post would change everything and I'll have a lot more motivation to write something in next few weeks.

I was about to start messing up with stylesheets but it has no point at this stage - I would spend too much time polishing things and doing-stuff-which-isn't-relevant. that's why when I'm writing this it's very very simple.

besides, it seems that I really like to start everything from scratch. I've decided to go with `jekyll` instead of using `middleman` for blogging. I've spent some time trying to get this working instead of use the solution which was already setup. it bothers me a bit but also helps to try new things.

wish me luck with blogging!

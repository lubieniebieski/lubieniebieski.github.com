Believe it or not, but most of the people don’t want to make other people's lives worse and they don’t plan to ruin your day! At least, I think so:)

After spending many years with different people, I’ve realised that what we feel about some decision or a situation isn’t the same what other people feel about it. And that’s the source of all the issues and misunderstandings.

I want to encourage you (& me!) to do three things:
* Don’t take decisions personally
* If you have doubts - simply ask the person behind it about their point of view.
* **Assume positive intent!**

If you want to talk to the person who you think might have done something bad/stupid and you disagree with this, don’t hesitate to express your concerns. The key thing here is to use some form of [Nonviolent Communication], by using your sincere feelings and explaining your point of view.

I try to follow this guidance and I never assume that someone (especially one of my co-workers) would like to do something bad. My algorithm is simple:
1. Accept the fact that someone has a different point of view
2. Try to understand it
3. Ask this person about things that concern you
4. *< someone is going to profit from this discussion >*
5. Move on

Assume positive intent, have a meaningful discussion and benefit from understanding a different point of view. It’s much better than getting angry and letting stress to come into your body.

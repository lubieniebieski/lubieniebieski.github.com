It was great! The most important insight for me was that I don&rsquo;t really need a full M version of the car, the one I tested is more than enough!</li><li>I spent a lot of time digging through BMW configurator, it seems that cars still make an impression on me.</li><li>February was not impressive in terms of bike trips, just 3 of them. I hope that my issues with the tires are gone and I won&rsquo;t have to spend most of the ride pumping them up.</li><li>February marks my 4th month in a row when I closed all the activity rings on my Apple Watch!</li><li>At work things were good but INTENSIVE, the highlight was a workshop we had in a bigger group in PoznaÅ„! First of all we closed some important topic, but there was also a lot of fun and a lot of learning! I also started in a new role &ndash; exciting things ahead of us!</li><li>I had my first experience as a host with Disruption Talks format, <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/events/howsaascantransformthehospitali7034870321421725696>it was fun</a>!</li><li><a href=https://www.flexispot.com/>FlexiSpot</a> surprised me when I reached out to them and they agreed to send me a new desk top for free (I had a small issue with the previous one).</li><li>Something triggered me to improve my backup game. I decided to leverage the power of my Synology and backup all the photos from all the phones at home to Synology (even though I use the big iCloud package). Just in case. Apart from that, I did some changes to running Docker containers on NAS and I&rsquo;m using it more and more for things other than just a file storage.</li><li>I&rsquo;m glad that my home is running almost entirely on Apple devices, just a few things left for migration. Not that I don&rsquo;t like other brands, but it&rsquo;s easier to have everything in one ecosystem.</li><li>Health is good!</li><li>I felt urge to learn CSS from scratch, hopefully I will find some time for it.</li><li>I wrote 5 posts on my blog! That&rsquo;s more than in 3 last years combined!</li></ol><h2 id=few-random-links>Few random links<a href=#few-random-links class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><ul><li><a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma>https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma</a></li><li><a href=https://logseq.com/>https://logseq.com/</a></li><li><a href=https://dokku.com/>https://dokku.com/</a></li><li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/@flavourtrip>https://www.youtube.com/@flavourtrip</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4aPeeI64CA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4aPeeI64CA</a></li><li><a href=https://letterboxd.com/>https://letterboxd.com/</a></li></ul><h2 id=posts>Posts<a href=#posts class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><ul><li><a href=https://lubieniebieski.pl/cyk/007/>Cyk007: One night in KrakÃ³w, KrakÃ³w, 2023</a></li><li><a href=https://lubieniebieski.pl/posts/2023/02/uses-page-is-up/>Uses Page Is Up</a></li><li><a href=https://lubieniebieski.pl/posts/2023/02/exploring-www/>Exploring WWW</a></li><li><a href=https://lubieniebieski.pl/posts/2023/02/playing-with-webmentions/>Playing with Webmentions</a></li><li><a href=https://lubieniebieski.pl/january-was-nice/>January was NICE</a></li></ul><p>February, <strong>thank you! ðŸ’™</strong></p></div></div></article></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>Â© 2023 Powered by <a href=http://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>

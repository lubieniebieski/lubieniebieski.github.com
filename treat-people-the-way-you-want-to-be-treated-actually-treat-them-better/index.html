It works!
And this year I want to make it more special, so I add <em>treat them better</em> on top of that.
How do I want to achieve that?</p><h2 id=be-nice-break-the-ice>Be nice, break the ice<a href=#be-nice-break-the-ice class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>If someone new joins my group, I need to make sure that the person doesn&rsquo;t get ignored and gets recognition from other members of the group.
I&rsquo;m going to <em>make the first step.</em>
It&rsquo;s easier for me to start, then it is for a new person. They might not know the group well and be worried about making a good introduction.
Or there might be a thousand other reasons which makes them uncomfortable.
I want people to enjoy their time and not to stress a lot &ndash; taking of that stress does do the job!</p><p>Example I like here is the very short and simple.
If I see someone waiting for a recruitment appointment, sitting somewhere in the lobby, I tend to ask what position do they apply for, who&rsquo;s going to be in the meeting, give them a hint (or two).
When after few weeks I can talk to this person as my new team mate and they remember the face I&rsquo;m really happy and satisfied that I&rsquo;ve made a good job.
There&rsquo;s a relation already and everything goes smoother with that in place!</p><h2 id=what-if-something-goes-wrong>What if something goes wrong?<a href=#what-if-something-goes-wrong class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>I see stuff failing all the times.
People are not happy about that.
My job is to make things smooth.
I want to be more helpful for other people and I want to do that by a few key guidelines:</p><ol><li><strong>Ask about the problem</strong> (don&rsquo;t assume anything), and remember than asking once is not enough.
The real problem lays deeper.
You can help by asking questions and thus forcing the person to take a step back.
You need to help them to get things in order.</li><li><strong>Don&rsquo;t make things worse by being ignorant.</strong>
If someone asks for help, give them the answer and try to narrow down the solution.
Saying nothing is worse than saying &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; or pointing to other person who might now the subject.</li><li><strong>Stay in the loop.</strong>
Don&rsquo;t quit the discussion after first round.
You&rsquo;re done when the dust settles.</li><li><strong>Make sure there&rsquo;s the incident owner.</strong>
It there is no one &ndash; congratulations, your job is to use your experience and make the problem go away.</li><li><strong>Ask if your help is enough.</strong>
We might thing that we&rsquo;re helpful, but the reality might be different.
Do one more step, and ask if &ldquo;there is anything else you can do&rdquo;.</li></ol><h2 id=why-do-all-of-that>Why do all of that?<a href=#why-do-all-of-that class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><blockquote><p><em>I&rsquo;ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.</em>

I really like the idea of uses page and I&amp;rsquo;m happy to have one, too! The first experiment back in the day was my workspace page &amp;ndash; a lot of people actually asked me about some details and recommendations. Thanks to these recommendations, my colleagues were able to save some time and (HOPEFULLY!) improve their work environment.

I really like the idea of &lt;a href="https://uses.tech/">uses page&lt;/a> and I&amp;rsquo;m happy to have one, too! The first experiment back in the day was my &lt;a href="https://lubieniebieski.pl/workspace-2021/">workspace page&lt;/a> &amp;ndash; a lot of people actually asked me about some details and recommendations. Thanks to these recommendations, my colleagues were able to save some time and (HOPEFULLY!) improve their work environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why? Because when I explore peoples&amp;rsquo; pages, I can learn a lot about them and how do they work. More importantly, I can learn about tools that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about before. And that&amp;rsquo;s what I want to do with my page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My uses page is just a click away in the main menu or you can just go straight to &lt;a href="https://lubieniebieski.pl/uses/">the /uses page&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Feel free to reach out to me if you find something interesting â€” I&amp;rsquo;m always open to discovering new ideas and tools!&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>

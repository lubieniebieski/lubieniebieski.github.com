For a few last days I had been thinking about it and I was really curious how it would work out. I had a few things in mind that I wanted to achieve with this change:
migrate away from my hosting provider and reduce costs have a static site that I can host anywhere (Github Pages included) have a site that is easy to maintain and update have a way to write posts in Markdown have a feeling of doing something new and exciting have a site that is fast and lightweight being able to write posts in my favorite editor (currently VS Code, as my Vim muscle memory faded away a bit) do something &amp;ldquo;hackish&amp;rdquo; and fun Here we are!</description><content>&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; Last night I had this idea of changing one more thing in my setup and that was to move my site from Wordpress to Hugo.
For a few last days I had been thinking about it and I was really curious how it would work out. I had a few things in mind that I wanted to achieve with this change:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>migrate away from my hosting provider and reduce costs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>have a static site that I can host anywhere (Github Pages included)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>have a site that is easy to maintain and update&lt;/li>
&lt;li>have a way to write posts in Markdown&lt;/li>
&lt;li>have a feeling of doing something new and exciting&lt;/li>
&lt;li>have a site that is fast and lightweight&lt;/li>
&lt;li>being able to write posts in my favorite editor (currently VS Code, as my Vim muscle memory faded away a bit)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>do something &amp;ldquo;hackish&amp;rdquo; and fun&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Here we are! I&amp;rsquo;m happy with the result! There are a few things that I&amp;rsquo;d like to introduce, like light/dark theme switcher or a better way of handling images, but I&amp;rsquo;ll get to that later.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Hello world!

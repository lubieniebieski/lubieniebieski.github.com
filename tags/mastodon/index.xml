In general RSS &amp;ndash; oh boy, I&amp;rsquo;ve never left the RSS boat, even after Google Reader was shutdown years ago.

Here&amp;rsquo;s how I spend my time, consume the content and communicate in the internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="in-general">In general&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>RSS&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; oh boy, I&amp;rsquo;ve never left the RSS boat, even after Google Reader was shutdown years ago. Right now I use it to browse a very diverse (also random) set of feeds to broaden my perspectives and follow the topics I&amp;rsquo;m interested about &amp;ndash; &lt;strong>without the comments/likes hustle&lt;/strong>.
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The last part is crucial for me &amp;ndash; RSS are about the content, not everything around it. That&amp;rsquo;s actually how I like to browse web.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Newsletters&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; when I was a very active developer back in a day, I felt that being on the edge with news about programming languages, new libraries, etc. was a must. After a while, I realized that receiving TOP-10 links from a given topic once a week is enough. I still believe that&amp;rsquo;s the case and that&amp;rsquo;s why I like reading newsletters:) One caveat &amp;ndash; RSS feed is still better when executed nicely.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mastodon&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; new player in the block, I covered it my another &lt;a href="https://lubieniebieski.pl/where-am-i-2023/">post&lt;/a>. Currently, it serves as my tiny social network and inspiration for browsing other people&amp;rsquo;s blogs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Random pages on the internet&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m combining Mastodon toots with subscribing to people&amp;rsquo;s feeds. Most of the time, people are not that active on blogs, write 10 pages a year or something like that. But that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what I like &amp;ndash; exploring this random stuff, finding great content (and collecting another ideas to explore). I still don&amp;rsquo;t want to leave &amp;ldquo;the bubble&amp;rdquo; but at the same time feel comfortable with content &amp;ldquo;on the edge&amp;rdquo;.
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This approach exposes me to a quite varied set of topics which I probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t find otherwise.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Facebook Groups&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; there&amp;rsquo;s really good content in FB groups! I avoid things that are &amp;ldquo;general&amp;rdquo;, like city-based groups, etc., I focus on specialized groups of people who talk and exchange ideas about a narrow topic, e.g. woodworking, car detailing or cycling. I don&amp;rsquo;t like the interaction process, but you can get a lot by the extended context of comments in some discussions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Messenger/Signal/WhatsApp/iMessage&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; depending on the group of people I&amp;rsquo;m interacting with, instant messaging app changes and I can&amp;rsquo;t really tell which one is my platform of choice. The biggest problem I have is that the most people are on the platforms I&amp;rsquo;d like to utilize the least ðŸ™ƒ&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>All these activities have enabled me to stay connected and up-to-date with the ever-growing world of the web. I enjoy the freedom of browsing, exploring and learning from the world wide web, and I am constantly experimenting and adapting to the best ways to do so. Even without realizing that I do experiment:)&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="work">Work&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Slack&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; most of my work happens there. Mentions, tasks, daily job. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to say it&amp;rsquo;s my main working tool - actually it is and my work happens through Slack. I do fun and serious stuff there, but there&amp;rsquo;s always too much going on.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>E-mail&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; not used that much anymore, forwarding from time to time, intros, contacting with people outside of the company&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>LinkedIn&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; networking is important part of my role and LinkedIn gives me the best visibility and chance to understand what&amp;rsquo;s going on &amp;ldquo;professionally&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>After writing this, I came to a conclusion that this is just a general outline of how do I interact with the Web, without concrete details. That&amp;rsquo;s totally OK &amp;ndash; if you would like me to expand some of the channels a bit, let me know!&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>January was NICE</title><link>https://lubieniebieski.pl/january-was-nice/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2023 22:19:03 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://lubieniebieski.pl/january-was-nice/</guid><description>Here are some of things that were with me in January. A few @adam tools and a few observations I have made recently.
Tools I realized that I like people and things that are NICE and welcoming. Places where we say &amp;ldquo;hello&amp;rdquo; to each other, where we are polite and where we are not afraid to ask for help or simply we can share what we think without being judged.</description><content>&lt;p>Here are some of things that were with me in January. A few &lt;a href="https://social.lol/@adam">@adam&lt;/a> tools and a few observations I have made recently.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tools">Tools&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I realized that I like people and things that are NICE and welcoming. Places where we say &amp;ldquo;hello&amp;rdquo; to each other, where we are polite and where we are not afraid to ask for help or simply we can share what we think without being judged.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="arc-browser2---a-browser-for-the-modern-web">&lt;a href="https://arcbrowser.com/">Arc browser&lt;/a> - a browser for the modern web&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>After a few years of browsing Internet and jumping on the Chrome boat right from the beginning, I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect that there&amp;rsquo;s going to be a browser that&amp;rsquo;s going to make me switch. But Arc browser did it. It&amp;rsquo;s fast, it&amp;rsquo;s simple, it&amp;rsquo;s beautiful and it&amp;rsquo;s NICE.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I love the sidebar and a &amp;ldquo;magic&amp;rdquo; feel of interacting with favorites and tabs. But most of all, I like how the entire thing is designed. It&amp;rsquo;s not just a browser, it&amp;rsquo;s a whole experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The way new releases are presented and also the way the team is communicating with the community is just amazing. Look at an example here: Arc team is presenting a release without major updates, but with a lot of small improvements. It&amp;rsquo;s just ðŸ’™.&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QVIMuNz1IRY" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Even though I&amp;rsquo;m usually the picky person, liking when everything is aligned, polished, pixel-perfect and beautiful &amp;mdash; I enjoy the &amp;ldquo;chaos&amp;rdquo; of what the Arc team is sharing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Their screens are messy, there are a lot of thinks on the desktop, record quality is not 8K, some footage is done via iPhone directly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But it&amp;rsquo;s all NICE.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="omglol3--a-social-network-">&lt;a href="https://omg.lol">omg.lol&lt;/a>- a social network (?)&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>After a recommendation in &lt;a href="https://yeswas.pl/">YesWas Podcast&lt;/a>, I was curious what this &lt;code>omg.lol&lt;/code> thing is. I thought it was a Mastodon server, but it&amp;rsquo;s more than that. For a small yearly fee, you get a subdomain &lt;code>YOURNAME.omg.lol&lt;/code> + a lot of extras including:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>web profile / simple homepage&lt;/li>
&lt;li>URL shortener&lt;/li>
&lt;li>custom DNS management&lt;/li>
&lt;li>weblog&lt;/li>
&lt;li>statuslog&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>/now&lt;/code> page (&lt;a href="https://sive.rs/nowff">link to the &amp;ldquo;movement&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>mastodon server&lt;/li>
&lt;li>email forwarding&lt;/li>
&lt;li>and many more&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>And what&amp;rsquo;s interesting, every feature is accessible via API. When you interact with the page you see a lot of things like:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>We hope you&amp;rsquo;re having a great day.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Need more help? Contact us at any time.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Colors are friendly, everything is extremely polished - links work, many feature are available, there&amp;rsquo;s a status page, &lt;a href="https://omglol.news/">news&lt;/a>, crazy domains. And when I got to the Mastodon instance, I was warmly greeted by &lt;a href="https://social.lol/@adam">@adam&lt;/a> who runs the entire gig. NICE!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>BTW: there&amp;rsquo;s a possibility to use all the cool features under your own domain, so if you feel like there&amp;rsquo;s something cooler than omg.lol domain, you can do it!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="mastodon8">&lt;a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve started my journey on mastodon early this year, you can see my activity by following &lt;a href="https://social.lol/@lubieniebieski">lubieniebieski@social.lol&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what Mastodon is, you can take a look here:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>So far, I like it and try to post something from time to time. I&amp;rsquo;m using &lt;a href="https://tapbots.com/ivory/">Ivory&lt;/a> on my iPhone and I&amp;rsquo;m still looking for a decent client for the desktop. The web version of the client is OK, but I&amp;rsquo;m missing the ability to resume the timeline when I finished last time, not to jump right away to the newest posts.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="hugo15-static-site-engine">&lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo&lt;/a> static site engine&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve already shared my hello-world &lt;a href="https://lubieniebieski.pl/hello-hugo/">post&lt;/a> regarding Hugo, but I forgot to mention that this entire thing is written in Go (Hu - Go&amp;hellip; !:D) which I recently explored as my language of choice for hacking after work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s fast, it&amp;rsquo;s NICE:) And you read this post â€” which I consider the biggest achievement of my migration from Wordpress to Hugo.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>

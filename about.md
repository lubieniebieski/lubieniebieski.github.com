# My name is Adam, nice to meet you!

![Adam Nowak]({{ "/assets/images/avatar-bio.jpg" | absolute_url }})

All I want to do on this page, is to share my thoughts with the world and help
others understand things which I struggle(d) with, so they don't have to come
through the pain by themselves!

I enjoy helping people. :raised_hands:

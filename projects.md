# Codestories Podcast

:microphone: [codestories.fm](http://www.codestories.fm/)

I'm a Podcast Host wannabe. This is my child. I host it together with
[Bartek](https://twitter.com/bpranczke). We talk a lot about development, best
practices, current technology trends. We share our tips about being a good
developer.

# Pinsible

:nut_and_bolt: [lubieniebieski/pinsible](https://github.com/lubieniebieski/pinsible)

It's my tiny project for Ansible for your Raspberry Pi. I just wanted to make my RPi setup persistent and play a little bit with Ansible. Have fun!

# Kudos / Props app

:blue_heart: [netguru/props](https://github.com/netguru/props)

I've started this app back in 2014. The idea behind it is to express saying
'thank you!' in a geeky way. It evolved significantly and right now it's the
main "thank-you" platform in Netguru. I'm really proud about how much we use
this app!

# Bankey

:money_with_wings: [lubieniebieski/bankey](https://github.com/lubieniebieski/bankey)

Get given characters from your password / text. It's my go-to tool when I need
to fill some clunky bank app login form and I need to put 1st, 2nd, 13th and
1823921th! character of my password. Very useful.

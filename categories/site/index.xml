For a few last days I had been thinking about it and I was really curious how it would work out. I had a few things in mind that I wanted to achieve with this change:
migrate away from my hosting provider and reduce costs have a static site that I can host anywhere (Github Pages included) have a site that is easy to maintain and update have a way to write posts in Markdown have a feeling of doing something new and exciting have a site that is fast and lightweight being able to write posts in my favorite editor (currently VS Code, as my Vim muscle memory faded away a bit) do something &amp;ldquo;hackish&amp;rdquo; and fun Here we are!</description><content>&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; Last night I had this idea of changing one more thing in my setup and that was to move my site from Wordpress to Hugo.
For a few last days I had been thinking about it and I was really curious how it would work out. I had a few things in mind that I wanted to achieve with this change:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>migrate away from my hosting provider and reduce costs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>have a static site that I can host anywhere (Github Pages included)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>have a site that is easy to maintain and update&lt;/li>

&lt;li>have a site that is fast and lightweight&lt;/li>
&lt;li>being able to write posts in my favorite editor (currently VS Code, as my Vim muscle memory faded away a bit)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>do something &amp;ldquo;hackish&amp;rdquo; and fun&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Here we are! I&amp;rsquo;m happy with the result! There are a few things that I&amp;rsquo;d like to introduce, like light/dark theme switcher or a better way of handling images, but I&amp;rsquo;ll get to that later.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Where am I 2023?</title><link>https://lubieniebieski.pl/where-am-i-2023/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2023 16:28:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lubieniebieski.pl/where-am-i-2023/</guid><description>After the events in Twitter back in 2022, I decided to rethink a bit my visibility there and other social media. Somehow, I ended up with a pretty old-school conclusion.
I&amp;rsquo;m giving this blog/site another go. I don&amp;rsquo;t expect to post multiple times a day, but a few entries a year would be a nice improvement comparing to the last few yearsâ€¦
Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m exploring a few things:
Mastodon lubieniebieski@social.lol as a Twitter alternative and re-entry to interactions in the webz if you&amp;rsquo;re out there &amp;mdash; let me know!</description><content>&lt;p>After the events in Twitter back in 2022, I decided to rethink a bit my visibility there and other social media.

&lt;li>2FA improvements with &lt;a href="https://www.yubico.com/">YubiKey&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Loving RSS more than ever (thanks &lt;a href="https://reederapp.com/" title="Reeder 4 for Mac and iOS">Reeder&lt;/a>!)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Changing my e-mail setup a bit &amp;mdash; I decided to buy a domain and run it on &lt;a href="https://ref.fm/u29262816" title="Referral link for Fastmail - get 10% off your first year!">Fastmail&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>My plan is to write about these topics a bit more in upcoming weeks.&lt;/li>

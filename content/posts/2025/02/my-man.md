The other day, someone close to me did something in a way that resonated with me, and without thinking, I said:Â _"You're my kind of person!"_[^1]
Later, as I was telling my wife Beata about it, she smiled and said,Â _"Your kind of person, huh?"_Â It made me laugh -- we're so in sync! And that's when I realized: this would make a great blog post!

So, what exactly makes someoneÂ **"my kind of person"**? Let me break it down:

### 1. A sense of humor and the ability to laugh at themselves

"My kind of person" has a lighthearted approach to life. They handle things with a positive attitude, aren't afraid to joke about their own weaknesses, and definitely won't get offended by a little dark humor. Being around them just feels easy.

### 2. Respect for time

If they say they'll be somewhere, they'll be there. If they commit to something, they'll follow through. No excuses, no last-minute "ekhm you know...". Trustworthy and reliable -- we love to see it. When you say you'll be there at 8, you're there at 8.

### 3. Willingness to help

This is the kind of person you can open up to, someone who listens attentively and genuinely cares. Whether it's something practical or emotional support, they are there for us. They ask,Â _"How are you doing?"_, and actually mean it.

### 4. Bias toward action

Less talk, more doing. Instead of endlessly analyzing every possibility, they jump in and get their hands dirtyâ€”even when things get tough. Maybe even especially in such cases! (blood, sweat and tears, anyone?)

### 5. Empathy and standing up for others

A good heart matters. "My kind of person" understands people's struggles, treats others with respect, and won't hesitate to stand up for someone who needs it.

### 6. They know the difference between 2000 Colombian pesos and 2 slightly less valuable 1000 pesos

If you know, you know.

Nodding your head while reading this?Â **You're my kind of person!** ðŸ’™

[^1]: At first, I wanted to write "my man! aka "mÃ³j czÅ‚owiek!" in ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± -- it sounded cool in my head. But in English, it might have a different meaning, usually used between guys as a term of friendship. Since I mean this in a broader sense, for anyone who shares these values, "You're my person!" feels just right!

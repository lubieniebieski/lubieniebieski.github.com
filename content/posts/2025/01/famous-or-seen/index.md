The other day, a friend of mine shared an exciting momentâ€”they received aÂ â™¡Â from a very famous person onÂ **Twitter/X**. Given their current follower count and reach, this was quite a thing! It made him proud to be noticed by someone he "follows" (someone I respect too, for that matter).

And honestly, it made me happy as well! I hold my friend, and their contributions, in such high regard -- so such recognition shouldn't come as surprise:)

On the very same day, I had a small yet meaningful moment of my own. I finally submitted aÂ Pull RequestÂ to theÂ [Hugo Theme Terminal repository][1], a theme lovingly crafted by **Radek** aka **panr**, someone whose work I've been using since the very start of my blog!
A few minutes later, my PR was merged, and it came with a short but wonderful comment:

It genuinely made my day -- a kind gesture that didn't take much effort but meant a lot. It's a good reminder that simple acts of acknowledgment can have a big impact.

It got me thinking -- beyond all the noise of likes, followers, and algorithms, there's still a valuable side to social media and the internet. These tools can let us be kind to each other, see and appreciate each other's contributions, and, sometimes, make someone feel "seen" ðŸ‘€. I'm not saying we all need this, but for a person like me -- it's definitely a nice thing!

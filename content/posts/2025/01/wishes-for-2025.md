As we step into a new year, an idea keeps buzzing in my head... What if big social media platforms just stopped working? Imagine a world filled with meaningful conversations, vibrant communities, and personal blogsâ€”where we don't spend time discovering [the most-watched TikTok video of 2024](https://www.tiktok.com/@looooooooch/video/7332342275151760642)[^1].

Mastodon feels like a glimpse of that future. With its independent servers and a lack of corporate interests chasing profits from your data, it's refreshing. I hope more people will explore it in 2025! But hmm... maybe I'd have to get active on those big platforms just to tell them to shut down first? ðŸ¤¡

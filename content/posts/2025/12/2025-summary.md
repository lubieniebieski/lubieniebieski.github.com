description: "A lot happened this year: I found a job, got back to full-time coding, kept running, read a ton of Jack Reacher, built some furniture, and even upgraded my battlestation. Most importantly, I feel calmer and more grateful, especially after watching my friend's journey turn from tears of sadness into tears of joy."

1. I started looking for a job in the early 2025 and a few long months later, I found one.
2. I reconnected with full-time programming after years in management. Code is simpler than people! As for AI - it helps me move faster, especially when I already know what I want to build. I used to be skeptical when ChatGPT showed up, but now LLMs are part of my daily tools and they genuinely help me "produce" code. I'm comfortable with it as long as it stays a tool, not the answer to everything (like looking for answers about how to connect electricity ☠️).
3. I read almost all the books in the Jack Reacher series (which I started in 2024).
4. I watched Gladiator 2. It was so bad that I regret it—and I'm still annoyed because my expectations were so high.
5. I kept running regularly and improved my 10K PB. I didn't do a half marathon this year, so my mileage wasn't impressive, but after a few weeks of inconsistent running at the end of the year I can clearly see it: staying active has had the biggest positive impact on my life over the last two years.
6. I started doing intermittent fasting more often, usually landing in the 16–20 hour range.
7. I stopped daily journaling. Reason: a first-world problem - Obsidian is not "one click away" for me anymore. My work laptop is locked down, stripped of anything that is not work related and switching contexts from one compuer to another is annoying. The drop in journal entries correlates 1:1 with the time I started a new job.
8. With Applausi (our startup for music teachers), we didn't make it into the accelerator program. Still, we had a blast with Ola and we're continuing in our free time. We'll make it happen eventually!
9. Travel highlight: during our Berlin trip we visited [DRIVE - the Volkswagen Group Forum][1]. Seeing a Carrera GT in person was a dream, and the whole place is full of nostalgic icons from the last 50+ years. If you're in Berlin, I really, really recommend it.
10. I worried less about artificial stuff. I enjoy a quiet, slow life with the people I've built relationships with over the years. And when I'm alone, I often catch myself thinking how lucky I am 🤷🏻‍♂️.
11. My friend Marek's fight with cancer had a huge impact on me. I'm so grateful we went from tears of sadness to tears of joy! 🥹
12. I upgraded my battlestation, a lot of 3d printing went into (or rather "under") it!
13. I finally visited the distillery museum that's just a few hundred meters from my home. I love listening to people who are really passionate about what the do and what are they interested in - mr. Grzegorz who is the "boss" there does a great job!
14. I built some furniture. I still love woodworking, even if I buy too many tools compared to the time I can actually spend in the garage. The best part is that what I build is useful to other people and that brings me real joy.
15. Music-wise - I re-discovered ASOT. It led to many hours of smile on my face!

Enjoy life, be good to other people!

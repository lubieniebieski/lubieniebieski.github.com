I've started 2018 by finishing a book ["Principles" by Ray Dalio][1].
I'm impressed about how you can use rules to create your own way of living.
I've decided that this year I'm going to implement MY principles and stick to them.
I would also like to share them with other people so they can see them and know what they can expect from me.
_Sharing, as a bonus, comes with an external motivation ðŸ™‚_

Here we go, 10 rules/guidelines for Adam Nowak, let's start with the first one:

## Slow down. Enjoy, don't rush

Not much to add here.
I've realised that in 2017, I've read more books than blogposts.
And I kinda liked it.
Instead of skimming through the content or navigating by headlines -- I took the time to enjoy the topic in a broad context.

This is connected to multiple contexts as well.
My job requires wearing a lot of hats every day and switching the context all the time.
I accept it, but I rather focus on doing one thing at the time than trying to handle multiple things at once.
I feel that's better in the long run and keeping focus helps a lot in achieving great results.
As I want great results as much as I want to enjoy my work -- slowing down and focusing seem like a good tips for me.

There's a great quote by David McCullough Jr which fits perfectly here:

> _Climb a mountain not to plant your flag, but to embrace the challenge, enjoy the air, and behold the view. Climb mountains not so the world can see you, but so you can see the world._

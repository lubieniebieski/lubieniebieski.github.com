After the events in Twitter back in 2022, I decided to rethink a bit my visibility there and other social media. Somehow, I ended up with a pretty old-school conclusion.

I'm giving this blog/site another go. I don't expect to post multiple times a day, but a few entries a year would be a nice improvement comparing to the last few years...

Currently, I'm exploring a few things:

- Mastodon [lubieniebieski@social.lol][1] as a Twitter alternative and re-entry to interactions in the webz if you're out there --- let me know!
- 2FA improvements with [YubiKey][3]
- Loving RSS more than ever (thanks [Reeder][4]!)
- Changing my e-mail setup a bit --- I decided to buy a domain and run it on [Fastmail][2]
- My plan is to write about these topics a bit more in upcoming weeks.

Cheers!

Summer 2023 -- I decided to buy a new bike.

## Criteria

- blue color
- gravel bike
- carbon
- hidden cables
- SRAM groupset
- 1x gearing
- electronic shifting
- price below 4k EUR

## Candidate(s)

Actually - there weren't many bikes that met my criteria.

Here's the only one I really considered: [Rose Backroad][1]!

## Additional motivation

I'm a big fan of what Weronika is doing. Just browse through [her Instagram][2]! Last year, she bought a Rose Backroad, and this is how I learned about this bike. I've been following her adventures for a while, asked for a few tips, and decided to join the Rose family.

**Thank you Werka!** I hope I will get 1/10 of your adventures!

## Initial issues

First of all, I didn't want to buy this bike because in the meantime, SRAM released a new version (D2) of the Force groupset. Most of the changes were about the fact that the new one has a rainbow-like sticker on the crankset. It was enough to hold me back for a while. Fortunately, after thinking loudly about my "issues", I've decided to buy the bike anyway.

I've ordered a wrong size, due to an incorrect measurement of my inside leg. I've ordered a bike with a frame size of 53cm, but I should have ordered a 55cm one. Another thing that pushed me to do so was the fact that the 53cm size was available in 5 weeks, the other one much later.

Long story short, I went to a bike fitter, tried the smaller one, didn't work. Then I ordered a bigger one, and it was much better. I've returned the smaller one, and I've got a refund. The process was easy and smooth, and I'm happy with the way Rose handled it. I was super afraid that they are going to be super picky about the condition (even though I've only ridden it for a few km), but they didn't even ask me about it.

## What I've changed

- I had carbon wheels (Evanlite New Gravel) from my previous bike, so I've swapped them along with the tires (Pirelli Cinturato Gravel M 40mm)
- Saddle -> Specialized Power Comp
- Some of the screws were silver, so I've replaced them with black ones 🙈
- I've lost my cadence sensor, so I've bought a power meter mount on the crankset 🤷🏻‍♂️
- Pedals -> Shimano SPD PD-M540

## First impressions

I can't give a full review just after a few activities and a few hundred kilometers, but I can share my first impressions.

- the bike is super light
- it's relatively easy to maintain a high speed[^1]
- I can ride any road I want, any terrain I encounter is not a problem
- it looks slick
- electronic shifting is fun
- additional mounting points are useful (but I haven't used all of them yet![^2])
- the stem is custom and it's not 100% perfect for me -- if you would like to change it at some point, it might be a problem to find something that plays well with the frame

## Pictures

Here are some pictures of the environment that the Backroad is used in

## Summary

I'm super happy with the bike! 💙 Currently, I'm the weakest element of the system and I'm working on it. I'm looking forward to the next adventures with the Backroad! Exploring [Squadrats](https://squadrats.com/) definitely helps with that!

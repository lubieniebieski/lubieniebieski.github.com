It was supposed to be a comedy, a moment when I could turn my brain off for a bit and enjoy some easy TV. However, it turned out to be so much more. What surprised me the most was the **amount of tears** I shed while watching this show.

## Recommendation

I started watching Ted Lasso just a few weeks ago. I had a tough time at work and needed something to cheer me up. I've heard good things about the show, so I decided to give it a try. I was hooked after the first episode.

I've asked around my close friends and colleagues, and everyone seems to love it. Especially those in managerial roles, as they can relate to what's going on in the locker room and on the pitch, even though they don't deal with footballers on a daily basis.

I started recommending it to other people, and the best part of it is the message I got on holiday, around 7:30 am, from a friend who said:

> "I started watching the series you recommended me because I had some time after 22. I stopped after 6 episodes" :D

I get a lot of satisfaction when my recommendation lands well! :)

## What I liked

Let's just stick with 10 items, in no particular order:

- Ted's optimism
- "Oi!" and all the British slang
- It's about football after all!
- The music
- Every single tear in my eyes while watching it
- Amsterdam episode (I was in Amsterdam when I watched it)
- Pep
- Dani Rojas' "Football is life!"
- Real-life issues and situations
- [Polish actress][2]

## Final thoughts

Just watch it! It's a great show! 💙

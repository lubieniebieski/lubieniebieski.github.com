It was supposed to be a comedy, a moment when I could turn my brain off for a bit and enjoy some easy TV. However, it turned out to be so much more. What surprised me the most was the **amount of tears** I shed while watching this show.

## Recommendation

I started watching Ted Lasso just a few weeks ago. I had a tough time at work and needed something to cheer me up. I've heard good things about the show, so I decided to give it a try. I was hooked after the first episode.

I've asked around my close friends and colleagues, and everyone seems to love it, especially people who are managers (maybe not football)!

I started recommending it to other people, and the best part of it is the message I got on holiday, around 7:30 am, from a friend who said:

> "I started watching the series you recommended me because I had some time after 22. I stopped after 6 episodes" :D

I get a lot of satisfaction when my recommendation lands well! :)

## What I liked

Let's just stick with 10 items, in no particular order:

- Ted's optimism
- "Oi!" and all the British slang
- It's about football after all!
- The music
- Every single tear in my eyes while watching it
- Amsterdam episode (I was in Amsterdam when I watched it)
- Pep
- Dani Rojas' "Football is life!"
- Real-life issues and situations
- [Polish actress][2]

## Final thoughts

Just watch it! It's a great show! ðŸ’™

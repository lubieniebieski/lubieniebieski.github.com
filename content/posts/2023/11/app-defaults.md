I'm captivated by small online trends, like the recent wave of sharing the default apps people use every day.

It started with Hemispheric Views' entertaining "[Duel of the Defaults!][1]" podcast episode and was further popularized by [Robb Knight's][2] excellent initiative to collect app defaults on his website <https://defaults.rknight.me/>. It's the software world's version of sharing desk setups, and I can't get enough of it!

It's nothing big, but you might discover some new apps or workflows that you haven't heard of before. I know I did when I was reading through other people's app defaults.

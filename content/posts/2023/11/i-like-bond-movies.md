... but I might be even a bigger fand of the music in Bond movies

Recently, I've been spending more time in front of the screen and came across the movie, [The Sound Of 007][1]. Its familiar sounds and music transported me into the world of 007 that I know well. The melodies brought some chills and painted vivid images in my mind. The stories, the behind-the-scenes tales of all the auditory impressions in 007 movies, fascinated me. I also liked hearing the artists talk about their work on the songs. It made me really like the movie because I could see 007 series from a different angle!

It occurred to me then - the bond I have with Bond[^1] movies goes beyond the action and plot. I'm in love with the accompanying tracks, the unique "Bond-songs". Despite their differences, they harmoniously blend with the narrative every time.

By the way, every aspect of 007 - from the filmmaking process, editing, and music, to the marketing efforts, featured watches, casting decisions, easter eggs, and nods to previous films - serves as a stellar example of a well-maintained brand. The complexity of logistics behind its consistent execution is incredibly impressive!

## My favorite Bond songs

Of course, all Bond songs are not crafted equally. We all have our own "*TOP BOND SONGS list*". Here's mine:

1. **Another way to die**
  {{< youtube hM5UJvnbbuY >}}
  That's not the best Bond song[^2], but it accompanies the movie "Quantum of Solace", the one with [Olga Kurylenko][2]. I might be biased because of her ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
  
2. **You only live twice**
  {{< youtube hs8uYxTJ530 >}}
  The opening sequence is a masterpiece and I love it! Ideal for a car ride somewhere in the mountains.

3. **We have all the time in the world**
  {{< youtube RMxRDTfzgpU >}}
  The charm of Louis Armstrong's voice is undeniable. The song is a perfect fit for the movie "On Her Majesty's Secret Service". The phrase "We have all the time in the world" is a great reminder to slow down and enjoy the moment. And it's also a great song for a car ride somewhere in the mountains.

4. **No time to die**
  {{< youtube BboMpayJomw >}}
  This song is all about the voice of Billie Eilish. Together with the rest of music for "No time to die" (composed by Hans Zimmer[^3]), it's a great fit for the movie.  

5. **Nobody does it better**
  {{< youtube SaV-6qerkqI >}}
  Calm, romantic, and a bit melancholic. It's a song that wakes a lot of emotions in me.
  
The harmonious fusion of music and movie in Bond Series is sheer brilliance, making each viewing - or rather, listening - experience unique!

[^1]: See what I did there?
[^2]: And definitely not the best Bond movie, either. Why? https://screenrant.com/james-bond-quantum-solace-movie-problems-bad/
[^3]: I might be biased again, because I love Hans Zimmer's music.

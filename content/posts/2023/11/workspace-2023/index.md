{{< /panel >}}

## Core setup

### Computer 🆕

I use a **[2023 Mac Studio][2]**.

M2 Max with 12-CORE CPU + 38-CORE GPU, 1TB SSD + 64GB RAM. More than enough for anything that I throw at it. Lightroom, DaVinci Resolve, Docker, VS Code, even browsing the web -- everything is fast and smooth. I'm really happy with this machine.

{{< image src="202311_X1009247-lubieniebieskipl.jpg">}}

I'm satisfied the most with the number of ports available. I can connect all my devices without any issues. Not a single dongle is required. I still have my Anker Hub connected to the computer, but it's mostly because of the cable management.

2023 is the first year when I bought a stationary Mac, after almost 15 years of using laptops. I'm happy with the decision, but I have to admit that I miss the portability of the laptop. If I had to travel a lot, I would probably stick to the laptop.

### Display

In 2017 I bought [LG 27UD88-W][4] display. It's 27";, 4K and it has a USB-C connection which works great as a laptop companion (one cable for power&display). Currently connected via HDMI.

The desktop is occupied by a beautiful GT3 Touring most of the time, or a different creation coming either from my own camera.

### Keyboard and mouse 🆕

I used trackpad for years, but when I switched to [MX Master 3 for Mac][8] -- I never looked back.
Great scrolling and customisation possibilities, I can have a different mouse-key bindings for each application.

Big change for me was switching to a mechanical keyboard. I started with [Keychron K14][3] some time ago and after some time changed it to [Kechron Q1 Pro][5]. I struggled a lot after switching from the Apple flat keyboard, it hurt for quite some time. Didn't give up, bought a funny things called arm rest from Fellowes and it helped a lot.

It has a blue `esc` key, has a knob, all the F-keys are available and it's a pleasure to type on it!

## Additional devices

I have a couple of additional devices on my desk as well.

### Speakers

Long time ago, it was 2002 or 2003 --- I dreamed of having a 5.1 speaker system. I bought Creative Inspire 6.1 6700 back then. They are with me for almost 20 years already, even though I use them as 2.1 system right now.

I use the sub and two satellites from the 6700 set. Why? Mostly because of the size (satellites are very small) and they have a wired remote which is glued to the bottom of my desk and I use it to control the volume of the speakers.

It's not ideal but for work --- this setup is pretty much OK.

### Headphones

I choose [beyerdynamic DT 990 PRO][10]. You can wear them all day long, they produce good reproduction of the voice and are aesthetically pleasing. I didn't like the original black/gray combination and went for the all-black edition. Until they arrived, I didn't notice that they come with a different impedance (250 vs 80 Ohm). Not sure how much I lost because of that, but I have to admit that the are great!

Additionally, I own a pair of Apple AirPods Pro 2nd gen. These are noise-cancelling headphones which help me to survive train/plane travels as well as help to cut off the environment when I need it.

### Microphone

My mic of choice is [Audio-Technica ATR2100x-USB][11]. I spend quite a lot of time on calls and look like a serious podcaster

{{< image src="202311_X1009249-lubieniebieskipl.jpg" >}}

It's a dynamic microphone and I think it much better suits my needs and it's a good choice for people who deal with a lot of noise around.

The microphone is mounted on a [Rode PSA1][14] arm and is one of the things that allows me to keep the desk tidy.

{{< image src="202311_X1009253-lubieniebieskipl.jpg" >}}

Microphone is capable of running via USB-C, but I picked up [Audient EVO 4][15] interface. One of the reasons was that the provided USB-C cable was too short. XLR cable is much more robust (and longer) and works fine with the setup. I like the fact that I finally have a hardware mute button available for me and I like the visualisation provided by white LED on the device.

### External camera

As I mentioned, I do a lot of Meet/Zoom/Slack calls every day, so it's important for me to have a decent Audio/Video setup. In addition to the Blue microphone described earlier, I use a [Logitech C922][16] webcam which offers nice quality and allows me to get a better angle than using a camera available on my MacBook.

### Clock

I would like it to be a piece of art, but --- this clock is some no-name LCD device bought for 50PLN on Allegro. It shows the temperature and the time obviously, but it also fits nicely to the black desk.

### Loupedeck interface 🆕

I'm not a professional photographer, but I like to spend some time in Lightroom and edit my photos. In order to improve my game and speed up the process, I've bought a [Loupedeck Live][7] device. It's a customisable interface which can be used with a variety of applications. I use it with Lightroom mostly and it's a pleasure to use it. It's a bit pricey, but it's worth it.

{{< image src="202311_X1009245-lubieniebieskipl.jpg">}}

Apart from using it in Lightroom, I use it as a macro keyboard. I have a couple of shortcuts configured for it and it's very handy -- switching things on/off, opening applications, managing windows, etc.

## The Desk

The desk is a custom-built one. Two pieces of Swiss Krono Worktop --- the front one 70x180cm and the side one (on the left) 60x110cm. It's very deep and there's plenty of space. The worktop sits on two [IKEA Alex drawers][18] which suit the black&white theme of the desk and offer additional storage for the commonly used items like cables, accessories, etc.

{{< image src="202311_X1009252-lubieniebieskipl.jpg" >}}

When I want to change my position from sitting to standing, I use a standing desk converter [FlexiSpot EdgeRiser][21]. Entire platform looks a bit ugly, like a transformer but it does a good job in delivering the ability of working in a siting or standing position. Everything is steady event in the top position. It's not electric, but it turned out not to be that much of an issue. The only challenge I had with this setup was the cable organisation. It's pretty clean now, after buying some cable organisers, double-sided tapes and other stuff.

### Shelves

{{< image src="202311_X1009251-lubieniebieskipl.jpg" >}}

Behind the computer, I have a few shelves. I use them to host some of my LEGO cars --- currently it's a [Porsche 911 RSR][6], a [Porsche 911 Turbo/Targa][9], and an [Aston Martin DB5][12].

Unfortunately, the plants don't survive in my office for too long, so after many casualties, I decided to go for a cactus 🌵. It's a nice addition to the shelves and it's easy to take care of.

### Lightning

I've added a few lighting sources around the room. The most important one is the [Yongnuo YN-300 Air LED][19] lamp. It allows my face to shine (lol) during the calls. There's a variety of combinations of how can this lamp be used, starting from flexibility of movement and ending up with the light temperature. Additionaly, I have some Philips Hue lights around the room to add some colour to the background.

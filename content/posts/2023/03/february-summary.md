Another month has passed and it's time to summarize it.

1. We had a little holiday in KrakÃ³w with the family. Hard to call it a regeneration but still, it was nice to spend some time together. We had a nice whether, including -10Â°C during the day. Highlights: Wieliczka, Wawel, [Muzeum Iluzji](https://krakil.pl/), [PaÅ‚ac Krzysztofory](https://muzeumkrakowa.pl/oddzialy/palac-krzysztofory), [WesoÅ‚a Cafe](https://wesolacafe.pl/), [AleKlocki](https://www.aleklocki.com/).
2. During the KrakÃ³w visit, I had a chance to experience the BMW 3 series for the first time in the 370+HP version and explore the city with my guide D. - thanks a lot for the opportunity! It was great! The most important insight for me was that I don't really need a full M version of the car, the one I tested is more than enough!
3. I spent a lot of time digging through BMW configurator, it seems that cars still make an impression on me.
4. February was not impressive in terms of bike trips, just 3 of them. I hope that my issues with the tires are gone and I won't have to spend most of the ride pumping them up.
5. February marks my 4th month in a row when I closed all the activity rings on my Apple Watch!
6. At work things were good but INTENSIVE, the highlight was a workshop we had in a bigger group in PoznaÅ„! First of all we closed some important topic, but there was also a lot of fun and a lot of learning! I also started in a new role -- exciting things ahead of us!
7. I had my first experience as a host with Disruption Talks format, [it was fun](https://www.linkedin.com/events/howsaascantransformthehospitali7034870321421725696)!
8. [FlexiSpot](https://www.flexispot.com/) suprised me when I reached out to them and they agreed to send me a new desk top for free (I had a small issue with the previous one).
9. Something triggered me to improve my backup game. I decided to leverage the power of my Synology and backup all the photos from all the phones at home to Synology (even though I use the big iCloud package). Just in case. Apart from that, I did some changes to running Docker containers on NAS and I'm using it more and more for things other than just a file storage.
10. I'm glad that my home is running almost entirely on Apple devices, just a few things left for migration. Not that I don't like other brands, but it's easier to have everything in one ecosystem.
11. Health is good!
12. I felt urge to learn CSS from scratch, hopefully I will find some time for it.
13. I wrote 5 posts on my blog! That's more than in 3 last years combined!

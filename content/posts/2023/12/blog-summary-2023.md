As 2023 draws to a close, I find myself reflecting on a year that reignited my love for blogging, introduced me to new digital communities, and helped me establish a writing rhythm that feels just right.

## Rediscovering Blogging

This year marked my return to blogging after a hiatus. Drawn to its simplicity and adaptability, I embraced the [Hugo][1] platform, choosing a [theme][2] that brought a personalized elegance to my virtual space.

## Impressed by Inspiration

Among the myriad of inspiring content creators, [Robb][3] stands out. His page, a beacon of creativity and dedication, has earned my unofficial "Web Award of the Year." His work is a testament to what passionate webcraft can achieve!

Kudos to all people maintaining their personal sites and blogs, **you're AWESOME**! üôå [The Web is Fantastic][4], you know?

## Finding My Writing Groove

Challenging myself to write more, I'm proud to have published a personal best of **40 posts** (including this one!). I wrote 0 posts in 2022 and 0 in 2021, so it's a huge improvement!

Adding "Bullets" was a game-changer, allowing me to share my thoughts in a more casual format.

## The Return of RSS

RSS feeds have made a triumphant return to my daily life, enriching my reading routine with curated content that keeps me connected and informed. For those yet to rediscover its charm, I urge you to give it a go. And if you have a blog, [Please, Expose your RSS][5]!

## Great Blogging Platform That Works

The trio of [Hugo][1], [GitHub][6], and [Netlify][7] has become the cornerstone of my blogging. Together, they provide a reliable and cost-effective solution that keeps my focus on creating content rather than managing a website. All the code is available on [GitHub][8].

One small addition to this trio is a [standalone app][9] written in Ruby that helps me to add some dynamic content to my blog. It's a simple app that fetches the data from various services (like what did I add to my reading lists, what are Mastodon links to my entries, etc.) and allows me to add them to my blog.

## Conclusion

Looking back on 2023, I'm filled with gratitude for the renewed passion, lessons, and connections blogging has brought into my life. It's with eagerness that I look forward to continuing this journey into 2024. To my readers, thank you for being a part of this voyage‚Äîmay our adventures in the blogosphere continue to flourish! üôè

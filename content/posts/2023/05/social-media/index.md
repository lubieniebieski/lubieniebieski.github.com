## Reflecting on My Social Media Experience

Back in 2010, I spent a lot of time on social media, mostly on Facebook. Looking back, I see that it was fun, but also had some dark moments (and humor as well). I used Facebook to keep in touch with my closest friends, workmates, and even some family members.

After Facebook, I started using Instagram. I liked seeing nice photos from other people. But, after a while, I noticed the photos were getting better and better. I felt that my photos were not good enough to share. So, I stopped posting and became less active.

At the same time, I had a Twitter account. I used it to follow some people, but I didn't really like it because there was too much happening!

I also used LinkedIn, but mostly for work-related things. I often found it hard to find what was important there. I also questioned whether I had enough good things to share or smart enough comments to make on other people's posts.

Something changed after that. Maybe I was becoming more mature, or maybe I wanted to spend my time more wisely at work. Either way, I started to spend less time on social media.

## My Ideal Social Media

Here's what would make social media better for me:

- I believe that social media should be a part of our daily lives.
- I want to chat more with my close friends, family, and workmates.
- Even if I don't know someone in person, I want to be able to relate to them and imagine spending time with them.
- I want to see what they are doing, what they are reading, listening to, watching, and thinking about.
- I want to share my thoughts with them and vice versa.
- I want to do this in a way that is not annoying and doesn't take too much effort.
- I think it would be nice to keep the conversation going, whether online or offline, because these two worlds are connected.

Yes, that would work really well!

## My Current Social Media Usage

I still have a Facebook account, but I don't post anything. Facebook groups are useful for finding information though! Mastodon is good. I only interact with a few users, but it's not bad. In fact, I'm more active there than before and I have quite a lot of fun!

LinkedIn is still helpful for my work, and Instagram is a nice break from my daily routine (which is not always as fun as the photos on the feed :)).

And finally, there's this blog. It's my space. I don't know who reads it, as I don't track any stats. But it's a happy place for me. I enjoy sharing what I know and what I find interesting! The blog gives me a sense of freedom; I'm not limited by platform rules or character counts. But Still, I would love some interactions; it doesn't have to be 1000 likes or comments, one would do!

The new series [Fallout][1] has been available on Amazon Prime for a while now, and I was excited to hear about its production. At first, after watching some trailers, I felt a bit concerned that it might not live up to my high expectations and end up being mediocre. However, I was mistaken -— **the series is genuinely GREAT**!

## Game was first

I began my journey with the Fallout universe nearly 25 years ago when full versions of both games were included with the CD-Action magazine I used to buy. Back then, as a teenager who didn't speak English very well, nothing (except maybe FIFA 98) captivated me as much as Fallout. It was a game that not only fascinated me but also left a profound impression. That experience likely sparked my love for turn-based games (which continues to this day), the post-apocalyptic atmosphere, and dark humor.

> War, war never changes.

## The story is somewhat similar

The character I created in Fallout strikingly resembles Lucy in the series. She has a good attitude towards people, a desire to help, lives by her principles, but also displays some naivety and lack of experience. However, as the story progresses, she gains more depth, isn't afraid to wield a gun, and does what needs to be done—in the Wasteland, sometimes you have to be brutally pragmatic. I had a lot of fun watching her character development and the way she interacts with the world around her, because it reminded me of my own experiences in the game.

I didn't expect that the TV series would add a lot of new elements to the Fallout universe, but it definitely helped me to understand the world better and see it from a different perspective.

## Recommendation

I am enchanted and delighted by this series rating it 9/10 and eagerly awaiting the next season!

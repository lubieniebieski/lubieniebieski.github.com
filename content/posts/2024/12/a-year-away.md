I always imagined writing a post with this title while lounging in a fancy place, like a cozy flat with a crackling fireplace, or maybe on a beach with the sound of waves in the background. Instead, here I am, sitting at my desk in front of my not-so-glamorous computer, reflecting on what turned out to be one of the happiest 12 months of my life.

My name is Adam, and last year I did something both terrifying and exciting—I quit my job at Netguru. For the past 12 years, I had been immersed in the software industry—writing code, ~~creating~~ fixing bugs, learning more than I ever thought possible, meeting some truly awesome people, and eventually stepping into leadership and management roles. And you know what? It was an absolute blast for the most part!

> Before I dive in, let me just say this: I feel incredibly privileged to be in the position I'm in. I worked hard in many areas of my life to make this possible, but I'm also keenly aware that having a strong foundation: family, health, and financial stability - was a huge factor. A few bad decisions or twists of fate, and I might not have had this opportunity at all.

## Fresh start

When I left my job, I didn't have a clear roadmap for what to do next. I just knew I needed some time. No hustle, no crazy goals. Just _time_. But as the weeks went on, I started thinking about things I'd always wanted to accomplish but had never managed to squeeze into my busy schedule. Here's what I came up with for my "life-on-pause" to-do list:

- ✅ Run a half-marathon (because why not torture myself in the name of fitness and longer life?) [Bullets#17]({{<relref "bullets/017">}})
- ✅ Start a LEGO-based side hustle with my wife (it's out there already - [Zabawnia](https://zabawnia.pl))
- ✅ Sell a piece of furniture I made with my own two hands [Bullets#14]({{<relref "bullets/014">}})
- ✅ Finish a long-overdue renovation on a few rooms in our house, and build a garden shed/storage space for all those tools and gardening supplies you need when you decide to have a garden [Bullets#9]({{<relref "bullets/009">}})
- ✅ _Actually_ keep in touch with friends instead of just thinking, "Oh, I should text them sometime!"

But this wasn't just about ticking boxes or chasing achievements. I also made a personal _non-negotiables_ list:

- Avoid stress, as much as humanly possible.
- No rushing! Seriously, no more rushing from one thing to the next like life is some kind of never-ending sprint.

I'll divide my learnings into few areas and describe how it went and what would I change (if anything).

### 1. Time Slips Away Faster Than You Think

When I started this break, I had this dreamy idea that I'd finally [have all the time in the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMxRDTfzgpU). No deadlines, no meetings, just endless hours to do everything! **Spoiler alert:** It didn't quite work out that way. Even with a calendar that was blissfully clear, life found a way to fill my days—errands, minor distractions, and my kids' endless stream of “brilliant” ideas. Suddenly, the day was over, and I hadn't accomplished Anything Meaningful™.

Looking back, I realize that a lot of the productive things I achieved in the past happened because I had two things: clear priorities and some pressure to push me forward. Without those constraints, it's surprisingly easy for time to just... drift away. Don't get me wrong, having more time is _fantastic_! But it's not the magical key to getting everything done.

If I could do it over, I'd add some structure—with certain days for exploring and others for working toward specific goals. Time management isn't just about squeezing tasks into busy schedules; it's just as important when your calendar is wide open.

### 2. When You're the One Pushing Yourself Too Hard

Here's a hard truth I had to face during this year off: I'm a bit of a workaholic. Even with almost no external pressure—no deadlines, no demanding boss, and no looming targets—I somehow found a way to overload myself.

I'd get sucked into a project, find that “flow state,” and keep going way past what was reasonable. The wild part? No one was asking me to do it. I just kept pushing myself—and, unsurprisingly, ended up feeling miserable more often than I care to admit.

But here's what really hit me: for most of my career, the person pushing me to work late, tackle extra tasks, or spend weekends glued to my laptop wasn't always the company. Or my manager. Or someone else standing over my shoulder with a deadline. _Most_ of the time, it was me. Sure, there were tough deadlines and moments when the company really cranked up the pressure (and yes, I absolutely suffered through those), but looking back, a lot of the extra hours and stress came from my own high expectations.

This year taught me the importance of knowing when to hit pause. Just because no one is setting limits doesn't mean there _shouldn't_ be any.

### 3. Too Many Options, Not Enough Focus

You'd think having unlimited options would feel freeing, right? Well, I learned it can actually be _paralyzing_. With so much time and so many possibilities ahead of me, I thought I'd dive headfirst into everything I've ever wanted to do. But instead, I found myself spinning in circles, unsure where to start.

The truth is, having endless options is amazing—for exploring, trying new things, or just wandering. But without a sense of direction, it's easy to get overwhelmed or, worse, spread yourself too thin.

The biggest realization I had in all this? **You simply can't do everything.** What worked for me was narrowing my exploration to just a few directions at a time—things I was genuinely excited about. Try something, see if it sparks joy, and if it doesn't? That's fine—drop it and move on to the next thing. Half the journey is figuring out what isn't for you so you can focus on what _is_.

### 4. Creating Space for Big Goals

Taking a year off gave me the kind of time and space I'd never had before—enough to dive into things that just wouldn't have been possible otherwise. Two big ones defined this year for me: woodworking and starting a toy rental business with my wife, called _Zabawnia_.

Woodworking wasn't about grand creativity or intricate designs—it was about enjoying the simple, meditative tasks like cutting wood, adding oil, and watching something functional come together. _Zabawnia_, on the other hand, was something entirely new—a true adventure. Getting it from an idea to a fully operational business took us months, and it's the kind of project I never could've finished if I'd only had a few hours here and there each week. Having the freedom to commit to it fully without distractions made all the difference.

This experience taught me that some goals don't just need “dedication” or “time management”—they need _space_. Without carving out that mental and physical room, those ideas wouldn't have gone from dreams to reality.

### 5. Rediscovering the Joy of Building

This past year, I realized something important about myself: I'm a builder at heart. Nothing lights me up quite like creating something with my own two hands—whether it's a piece of furniture, a LEGO set, or a fragment of (working!) code.

In my previous roles, when I led a team, I was still "building" in a way. We created systems, delivered projects, and accomplished big goals. But so much of that work felt intangible. And as much as I loved leading and problem-solving, I realized I _missed_ the tangible side of creating. There's something magical about starting with raw materials and ending up with something real.

I've decided that I want to keep this part of my life alive. If you're a builder, then build. Create things that bring you joy, and don't underestimate how deeply satisfying it is to see and feel the results of your work.

## Summary

I found balance in life. I started to appreciate the things I once took for granted. I learned that many clichés are true after all. Nothing monumental happened, and that's okay. Or maybe it does matter—it was refreshing to simply live without the daily grind weighing me down. I made progress. I enjoyed the journey, I'm proud of the outcomes, and I love the place I've ended up. I didn't have to wait until retirement to experience what it might feel like, and I've realized that if I want a happy retirement someday, I need to stay healthy, maintain balance, and nurture my passions along the way. Both the mind and the body need to stay in a good shape.

I wish everyone could have the chance to take a longer, uninterrupted break while healthy—to revisit their perspective on what really matters, what's worth chasing, and which things might not be as important as they seem.

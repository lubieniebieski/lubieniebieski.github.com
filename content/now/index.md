## What I’m enjoying

* I'm working on a few projects at the same time, I'm not bored at all! It includes woodworking and programming!
* Recently I've bought an action cam and I'm having a lot of fun with it! The only problem is that I'm terrified of the fact that you have to do something with the footage, otherwise it's just a waste of time and money.

## What I’m exploring

* I'm exploring e-commerce world using Ruby on Rails and implementing things like shopping cart. I'm also learning Turbo Streams which I haven't used before.
* I want to build a workbench for my "workshop". Try `paulk workbench` in Google Images and you'll know what I mean.

## What I’m watching

* I'm on season 3 of Slow Horses, 4th season of True Detective and in the middle of 2nd season of Ted Lasso (re-watching).
* YouTube keeps on recommending me videos about woodworking and I'm not complaining.

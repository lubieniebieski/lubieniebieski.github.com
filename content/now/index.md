## What I'm enjoying

* Most of my projects are done and I'm enjoying the results.
* I'm going through Advent of Code 2024 and I'm having fun, as always (until I hit the wall).
* I got back to running after a longer break! I feel much better when I'm active.

## What I'm exploring

* I'm exploring job opportunities and I'm open to new challenges.

## What I'm watching / reading / listening to

* I'm on book #7 from Jack Reacher series by Lee Child. I like the action and the way the story is told. Books are available via my monthly subscription to Audioteka, so I don't have to worry about the price.

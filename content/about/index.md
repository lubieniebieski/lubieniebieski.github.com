## My name is Adam, nice to meet you

People usually call me "adamo".

All I want to do on this page is to share my thoughts with the world and help others understand things which I struggle(d) with, so they don't have to come through the pain by themselves!

I enjoy helping people. 🙌

## You will see a lot of blue here

I love blue. 💙

`#lubieniebieski` and `#0092ca` are something I use a lot.

And I often use it as a color for my avatars, nicknames, etc. That's why I'm "known" as `lubieniebieski` (which means `blue lover` in Polish) on the Internet.

I was wandering through Dubai when I saw a breathtaking Bugatti Divo with a finish in the most stunning shade of blue, parked inside a luxury car dealership. This wasn't just any car; it was fast[^1], rare[^2], and carried a price tag to match[^3]. But beyond its speed and rarity, it was the paint job[^4] that captivated me, love at first sight. üíô

Check out this video from the dealership showcasing the very car that won me over:

Next to this blue-coloured beast, there was a red one, a little bit older, but the one which is one of the most recognizable üêé Ferrari models, the F40. It was a nice contrast to the blue Divo, and I couldn't resist taking a shot of it as well.

[^1]: The Divo is powered by an 8.0-litre quad-turbocharged W16 engine, which produces 1479 horsepower and 1600 Nm of torque. It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in 2.4 seconds and has a top speed of 380 km/h.
[^2]: Only 40 Divos were produced, and they were all sold before the car was unveiled to the public.
[^3]: This particular Divo costs costs about $10 million; initially it was priced at $5.4 milion which is more than twice the price of the Bugatti Chiron, the car on which it is based.
[^4]: You will see that the color from the video is a little bit different than the one in my photos, but either way, it's a stunning shade of blue.

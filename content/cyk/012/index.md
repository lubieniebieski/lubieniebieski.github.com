Here are some photos from the making of pierniki in Toruń, Poland, 2024. When I look at these pictures, I can almost smell the gingerbread. The recipe is quite simple, you need:

- honey
- cinnamon
- pepper
- nutmeg
- ginger
- cloves
- flour

and then you mix it all together and bake it 🤷🏻‍♂️.

Oh, and if you happen to be in Toruń, you should definitely visit [The Living Museum of Gingerbreads][1]. It's a great place to learn about the history of gingerbread and see how it's made. Enjoy!

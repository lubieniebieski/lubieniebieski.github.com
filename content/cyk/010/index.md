I went out to the car and headed to the Paczkomat[^1] in order to send a package, and I saw this mist forming over the fields. I took the drone for a spin and captured a nice view of my closest neighborhood.

Below are a few more shots from the flight.

And yes, I still haven't forgotten about delivering the package!

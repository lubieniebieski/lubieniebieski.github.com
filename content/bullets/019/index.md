Welcome to Bullets #19! Sit back, relax, and dive into the latest edition of the [series][2], you can also catch up on the previous edition [bullets/18][1].

A good thing about my writing is that I have a direct contact with my reader(s):D And one of them just emptied their RSS queue and asked for a new edition of Bullets. So here it is!

* Spring is in full swing! I love the green colors during my runs; I feel much better in such an environment!
* Speaking of the outside world, I continue to run in preparation for an upcoming 10k race in May. It will be my attempt to go under 50 minutes as much as possible (even one minute less would be cool!).
* There's not a lot of cycling these days (I've probably watched more on TV), but from time to time I manage to take my sons for a short ride around the neighborhood. Today I realized that having some sort of intercom would be cool during such trips. Even though we ride close to each other, when we go to busier streets, I would really like to avoid screaming and the current way of communicating. I'm thinking about buying some sort of intercom, like for motorcyclists. No research yet, but something likeÂ [BiKom 20 from Sena][3]Â looks promising. Maybe you have some thoughts about it?
* On the professional front, I find recruitment hard. After more than 10 years of recruiting other people, I am now being recruited myself. I must say, I prefer the first perspective :) Definitely this topic deserves an article on its own. For now, the TL;DR is: it's a tough game!
* On the other semi-professional side of my life, I've delivered another commission to my son for his birthday - custom build wardrobe. I'm very pleased with the results, I've learned a bit about working with black paint and designing custom handles. Little boy is happy, finally we have enough place to store his toys:-)

* We did a trip to WrocÅ‚aw. The main point was to visit the water knowledge centreÂ [Hydropolis][4], which I can recommend. Lots of interactive exhibits, very interesting stories about water, and nice exhibitions â€” definitely worth visiting!
{{< figure src="202503_IMG_6758-lubieniebieskipl.jpg" caption="A lot of ships, vessels, smaller and bigger boats on a display" >}}
* We also had an unfortunate event with the car â€” one lady didnâ€™t stop before our car, and the bumper + trunk lid were damaged. Current status is that we're riding an SUV as a replacement vehicle while the parts for the Mazda are being ordered and replaced. After driving a few days with a different car I can see that infotainment and camera quality are far superior in newer cars than in mine, but to be honest, I still don't fancy SUVs and like the high revs of my 6! :)

* Another car topic: yesterday we visited a motor show in Poznan. It was very cool to take my boys and spend quality time with them. They are into cars, so they were very pleased with the event â€” seeing Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Aston Martins, McLarens, drift shows, etc.! What I realized after the show is that I might have a sweet spot for RAMs. And this color...

Enjoy Spring, folks!

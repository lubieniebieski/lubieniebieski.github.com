Welcome to Bullets #7! You can read the previous one here: [bullets/6][1].

## COVID

* 😷 I got hit by COVID recently -- fever, caugh, headache, the whole package.
* I isolated myself from my family for a few days, barely remembering things and only leaving my room to eat.
* After three weeks I'm still not 100% back to normal, but I'm getting there.
* Though I didn't accomplish much during my sickness, I'm grateful for my recovery and my family's well-being.
* ⚠️ COVID is not over!!

## Unemployment

* Huh, that will be another blog post for sure.
* 😱 After 12 years in Netguru, I decided that this is time for a change and quit.
* 🤩 I feel like I've done my job, all the major things I wanted to do, I did, my team is great, and I feel like they can lead the company to the next level. Apart from that, I wanted to do more with my own hands, and I didn't have enough time for that. It's going to change now!:)
* 🥹1/3 of my life was spent there, and I'm very grateful for that time! 💚

## 007

* 🎥 It's the 7th edition of "Bullets", and coincidentally, I've also published a post [about Bond (007) movies][2]
* I'm thinking about rewatching last 5 Bond movies with Daniel Craig, but before I do that, I decided to do the same with the Mission Impossible series -- I don't remember them very well, but I feel like I need to see some action movies now!
* 🫵 Do you have some action movies recommendations? Let me know!

## Plans for the future

* 🛠️ Currently, I'm doing quite a lot of things around the house, rennovating kids room, planning some furniture, building a garden shed/garage, fixing all the old todo items.
* COVID slowed me down, but I'm recovering and getting back on track.
* 🪵 I have 3 woodworking projects in progress, and I'm planning to finish them before the end of the year. Table saw sled is almost finished, open wooden wall is in the making (I have all the materials, need to cut some grooves and assemble it), shelves and drawers for the bedroom are in the planning phase.
* 😬 I'm enjoying woodworking but non-standard cuts on the saw table can be intimidating. Even though I'm thinking about woodworking as a hobby and fun activity, I often think about how dangerous it is.

* ⌨️ So yeah, long-term plans are definitely about being in the IT industry, it should be easier to keep my fingers intact.
* I'm also planning to start a small business related to LEGO, it will be a micro business, but it should be a fun excercise and a good way to learn new things in life!
* I'm preparing for [Advent of Code 2023][3], I'm planning to do it in Go, and I'm very excited about it! I've [prepared repo][4] already, it will be fun!

## I no longer have a laptop

* 👨🏻‍💻 I decided to work on a desktop computer only, bought a Mac Studio and finally I have enough slots to put all the cables I need.
* 👾 This thing is a monster, it does everything instantly and doesn't make any noise.
* The truth is, due to the fact of mobility, or rather the lack of it, I'm not using the computer as much, as I used to, but again -- I'm not worried about it. I know that when the time comes, I'll crush all the tasks I need to do! 💪

## Open Graph previews

* 🔎 I've added a smart `og:image` tag to the blog, so now when you share a link to the blog post, it will have a nice image attached to it, even if I don't add any cover image to the post. Thanks [Łukasz][5] for the [inspiration][6]!

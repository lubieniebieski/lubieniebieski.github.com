The weather is great, the trees are green, and the flowers are blooming. The days are long, and when it rains, it's not cold. I love May!

Things are going well for me!

**May is my favourite month of the year!**

üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I'm really proud to have surpassed 200km running this year. It's more than I've ever run in a year! And we still have a few months to go! My small dream is to run a half-marathon in one go. We'll see if I can make it happen.

ü™ë 2 [#woodworking][3] projects have been monetized! It's my first time in more than 10 years of getting paid for something other than IT programming/consulting! Ain't much but it's honest work :D

üéÇ My younger son is really into cars. Every week, I have to buy him a new issue of the "Motor" magazine. Look at the cake he had on his birthday! Everything was edible! The cake was delicious!

üè¶ I experimented with home budgeting a bit. Instead of taking the simple approach, I chose to explore the options available on the market. My goal was to find a self-hosted, open-source solution that would help me manage my budget and allow me to import from different sources.

* I ended up with [Actual][4] and a bunch of importers/parsers. The flow is:
  1. Download CSV, save it in a Downloads folder (bank statements, Allegro history)
  2. Hazel watches the folder and moves the file to a specific folder
  3. Run a script that parses the CSV from banks and creates it own version of data in JSON/CSV formats
  4. Run a script that imports the data to Actual
  5. Check if everything is ok, categorize the transactions, and check if the balance is correct
  6. Profit!

* One special mention for a Rails project [Maybe: The OS for your personal finances][5] -- it's still early, but I'm watching it closely.

üöó I test drove the Tesla Model Y and while I wasn't completely blown away, the experience exceeded my expectations. I'm not a Tesla fan yet and not quite ready for an electric car, but I must admit that the prices of Teslas and the value they offer are highly competitive compared to other car manufacturers. However, it's worth mentioning that there was a BMW dealership near the Tesla Demo Drive and we couldn't resist exploring some options there too. I still don't have a strong preference for SUVs; I still prefer Tourings... Speaking of which, the [last time I mentioned][6] the 3 series, I was genuinely impressed!

üìù I see a lot of posts with `#WeblogPoMo2024` -- even though I'm not "attending" with my content, it's fun to read all the stories, my RSS backlog is getting bigger and bigger!

Have a great month Folks!

Welcome to Bullets #13! Sit back, relax, and dive into the latest edition of the [series][2], you can also catch up on the previous edition [bullets/12][1].

🏔️ Back in December, I visited the Karkonosze mountains and had a great time, as you might remember from [Bullets #9][3]. This week, my family and I went there again, accompanied by another family. The weather was completely different this time; it wasn't as magical as it was in December, but we still managed to go hiking and spent two nights in a mountain lodge.

📸 Why do all the families I see on Instagram or social media appear so happy? Parents never seem to complain about anything, etc. If I were to share a few snapshots of the conversations or situations we experienced on the trip, it would definitely present a much different picture than what we are accustomed to. Instead, I will simply say that children are much more adept at descending than ascending, and sweet motivators like chocolate or candies work wonders 🙈.

🪑 I'm making progress with my wood projects! One bathroom cabinet is finished, and it would have been ready to hang on the wall if I hadn't mistakenly measured the distance between the walls as 0.5cm wider than it actually is. So, I need to make a small adjustment and it should be ready in a few days! In the meantime, another cabinet is completed, and there are no issues with its dimensions. I'm excited to ship it next week!

⌨️ The other two sites I'm working on are progressing nicely. The domains are ready, and one of them even has a logo! I want to give a big shout out to [Andy Carolan](https://www.andycarolan.com/) for his work. I'm very happy with the result! Zabawnia will be a place where we will be renting toys, games, and LEGO sets for children (and not only for them!). Perhaps a small sneak peek first:

👨🏻‍💻 I don't regret writing the e-commerce part from scratch. I've learned a lot and had a lot of fun doing it! I know there are multiple no-code/low-code solutions out there, but after browsing them for a while, I realized that it would take me a lot of time to become proficient with them. Plus, I might hit a dead end without knowing how to move forward. Ruby on Rails is a really cool technology that has matured a lot over the years. I'm satisfied with it as part of the technology stack for my new projects!

🤖 My free Copilot license for Open Source has expired, so I immediately purchased it again. It's a huge time-saver for me and a great companion that helps me throughout the day when I'm dealing with code!

❓ I am currently considering how to manage deposits in our business. In the majority of cases, I will be returning the deposit to the customer. I am looking for a solution that minimizes the fees charged by payment providers. Ideally, I prefer not to have the funds transferred to me initially, but I still want to have a means of retrieving my money if necessary. I am aware that this is not a unique problem and believe there must be a suitable solution out there. If you happen to know of one, please inform let me know!

📽️ I made it to [Boilingfrogs](https://2024.boilingfrogs.pl/) for the 3rd time in the last few years! In addition to attending informative sessions about DDD, clean code, and architecture, the highlight of the event was definitely the time I spent with Radek. We shared a ride, a room, some beers, and burgers! Thanks, M8! 🙇🏻‍♂️

🚴‍♂️ This season, [Tadej Pogačar](https://firstcycling.com/rider.php?r=45992) won Strade Bianche and finished 3rd in Milan-Sanremo. In addition, this week he achieved 4 other stage victories and won the GC in Volta Catalunya! It's really enjoyable to watch him race. As is often the case in this professional group, there are certain things that make you laugh, even when the stakes are high.:
  > *"Nobody wanted to pull, so we came from behind, me and Domen, and we'd like to pull but nobody held our wheel," he said. "So we had a little bit of a gap – 100 metres, 200 metres – so we stopped for a pee and hid in the bushes so the peloton didn't know where we were so it was just a little bit of fun."*

👋 That's it this time! "Nothing really happend", but writing about it was a fun thing to do!

Welcome to Bullets #21! Sit back, relax, and dive into the latest edition of the [series][2], you can also catch up on the previous edition [bullets/20][1].

I feel like a hacker. I'm writing this edition of Bullets using NeoVim. After a few weeks in my coding job, I started to feel some nostalgia and need to start tweaking my development setup. What could be less dramatic than switching my main editor/IDE? I think my peak Vim-use was around 12-13 years ago, so it's fun to navigate via `hjkl` again.

Let's go through some bullets!

* So for starters, I'm going to recommend [NeoVim][3] as an interesting project. I initially wanted to use something ready-to-go like [LazyVim][4], but it was too good and had too many features -- I simply couldn't understand what was happening on my screen. So I decided to start from scratch and build my config slowly, making sure I understand most of the configuration I use. My config is available on my Github: <https://github.com/lubieniebieski/config.nvim>.
* Tour de France 2025 has already started a few days ago. Things are looking good -- Tadej Pogacar is wearing a yellow jersey, stages are exciting, many great cyclists fight for something - be it one of the jerseys, an individual good result in one of the stages, helping out their teammates, etc. I think you have to do more than just watch the transmission of the race. Because let's not fool ourselves, it's 3 weeks of 170+ men in lycra riding their bikes for a few hours each day. I must admit that I enjoy it more and more with each year, because I watched some races, witnessed some historic moments already, but I also try to follow the TdF from behind the scenes, like watching short vlogs from [Victor Campenaerts][5] and bringing back memories from 2024 by watching the "Tour de France: Unchained" on Netflix.
* My woodworking hobby brought a mud kitchen for my kids, you can see it below -- there will be some additions like some old pots and cutlery, but besides that, our little (but HEAVY!:D) family project is live, and boys are already playing with it! <happy dad!>

* Today I told my younger son that one day we're going to attend [Goodwood Festival of Speed][6], as he's into cars, he immediately liked the idea. Maybe I've read and watched too much coverage from this year's Le Mans (where Robert Kubica and his team won!), but it really sounds like a good idea for a trip for us:)

No more bullets today. I'll try to post more frequently, keeping them shorter and easier to read :) Have a great day folks! üíô

PS: Writing this post in NeoVim took me longer than it would have in Obsidian or VS Code -- I missed all my snippets and smart shortcuts. It might seem counterproductive, but I truly believe the best way to learn is when it hurts a little. When you start missing something, that's your cue to build or improve it. Pure kaizen: not just jumping to a tool that solves your problem (and 567851 others you don't have), but growing your setup as you go. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

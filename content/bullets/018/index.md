Welcome to Bullets #18! Sit back, relax, and dive into the latest edition of the [series][2], you can also catch up on the previous edition [bullets/17][1].

Last edition of "Bullets" came out in October '24, so it's been a few months... Let's fix it ASAP!

Tadej Pogačar won the Strade Bianche again! Even though he fell at one point and had a brutal accident, he still managed to finish first. What a sportsman! Unfortunately, our Kasia Niewiadoma also crashed, but her accident was more severe, and she had to abandon the race. So, it's a bittersweet day, but it's always a joy to watch the riders race on the beautiful roads of Tuscany. I'd love to go there again -- hopefully soon!

We started playing [Rummikub][6] as a family. It's a board game that requires a bit of luck and a good eye for spotting patterns—quite addictive too! I highly recommend it if you and your team know the colors and numbers from 1 to 13. You'll be good to go and will have a great time!

Spring is around the corner, and I can't wait! Running is so much more enjoyable when the sun is out, and I don't have to wear multiple layers of clothing. I also think that in a few days, I'll disconnect my bike from the Wahoo trainer and start covering some outdoor kilometers again. My Zwift subscription has already expired, so... ;)

After countless hours of research, I finally pulled the trigger and copied [Marco's][3] move—I'm now a happy owner of a new 32" [OLED ROG monitor][7]. Quick review: it's too good for my coding needs, but for everything else, it's simply awesome! Prices have dropped significantly in recent weeks, so if you're in the market for a new display, you may want to consider the `PG32UCDM`.

I've recently made some attempts to get back to (paid) work[^1]. The job market is pretty wild—hundreds of CVs are being sent for every open position. There are a lot of people looking for jobs, but also a flood of bot-generated CVs that look legit but are often useless. Anyway, the job market is quite competitive. It's a great time for companies to hire top talent, but it's challenging for individuals looking to advance their careers. More on this topic in [Gergeley's article][4]

Not so long ago, there was a lot of snow in the area, and I decided to pick up the drone, record some footage, and put it together in a form of movie, here's what I got https://youtu.be/PB_bQK0ze2A. I was also testing CapCut for this particular edit, but I still prefer Davinci Resolve as my go-to-editor[^2].

I'm on Book #15 from [Jack Reacher series][5]. If you like action, Bond or Bourne movies, you'll love these books. I definitely enjoy them, and I'm looking forward to the next one!

A good friend of mine has been fighting cancer for some time now. He is strong. The trajectory seems to be positive, and I hope he'll be back to his normal life soon. 🙏 When we talk on the phone and I hear him in good spirits, speaking positively—it immediately makes me forget about my own problems (what problems?!). **Stay strong, my friend!** 💙

[^1]: In general, I'm working my butt in many different ways, but I'm not getting paid for it, except for the occasional furniture/woodworking stuff which I do for friends and family. I'm not complaining, but I'd like to get back to the IT world, at least part-time.
[^2]: It doesn't mean I use it:D It's still very time consuming for me and I need hours to produce just a few minutes (and I'm still far from proud of it).

Welcome to "Bullets"! I'm bad at naming, ChatGPT didn't help me with that, so I'm going to call this series "Bullets" for now.

- 😮 Yes, the content is going to be presented in bullets. This shouldn't be a problem though! I was thinking about the structure for some time already, started to write some monthly summaries before, tried to move that into weekly and... it didn't work.
- 💬 Why don't I try something that doesn't require me to stick to a weekly cadence and allows me to write about whatever I want?
- 🤦🏻‍♂️ I wanted to use an emoji next to the title, but apparently there's no such emoji available. `:shrug:` ?
- 👇 Let's have some bullets below, shall we?
- ⦾ I realized that reading through other people's summaries and lists, often in a concise format, gives me a lot of inspiration and ideas on how I might iterate some of my own processes.
- If that format works for me, maybe my own bullets will work for someone else?
- 💙 I found out that for the [US market][1], the new ID Buzz is going to come in this beautiful blue color which is not available in the Polish configurator (yet?). Totally fell in love with it! {{< image src="https://assets.volkswagen.com/is/image/volkswagenag/VW_NGW6_Showroom_IDBuzz_MoodGallery_16-9_ItsBack?Zml0PWNyb3AsMSZmbXQ9d2VicCZxbHQ9Nzkmd2lkPTE5MjAmaGVpPTEwODAmYWxpZ249MC4wMCwwLjAwJmJmYz1vZmYmM2E1Nw==">}}
- 🪚 I've done some cool things recently, including a little bit of wooden DIY around the house. Nothing eye-pleasing (a little bit of fence for waste containers :D), but it was fun to do it myself and reuse material that was lying around.
- 🛒 I did buy an app called [Bobby][2] (it tracks spending on subscriptions), thanks to one and only [Marco][3] and his [weekly summary series][4]. It didn't make me smile though. Nevertheless, I feel better now, knowing how much I'm spending and on what.
- 🚲 [Bobiko][5] amazed me with his [casual 370km ride from Sopot to Gniezno][6]. I was happy last week to see 100km+ covered during the entire week. Need to improve my cycling game!
- 🤔 I'm thinking a lot about sharing and consuming content, ideas and thoughts in my work environment. Things aren't that easy, I'd like to have a comfort of RSS-like activity, but the pace is a little bit faster. I'd be happy to hear about your solutions -- what works for you? Brown bag sessions? Internal newsletters? Slack channels? I'm curious!
- In [Ivory][7] 1.0.1 you can change the icon now. And now there's a blue 🐘 sitting in my dock!

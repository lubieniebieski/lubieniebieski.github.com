Welcome to Bullets #8! You can read the previous one here: [bullets/7][1].

## Productive Blogging in November

* November tallied seven posts – a leap from October's zero and September's one.
* Writing more signals a positive shift for me.
* My posts combining tech insights with personal musings embody my ideal blog style.
* Kudos to @Marco for resuming his [What caught my attention...][2] series!

* This month, I've enjoyed following Polish bloggers [Paweł Grzybek][3] and [Michał Żelazny][4] for their compelling content.
* RSSes FTW!!! Remember folks, [expose your RSS][5]!

BTW, do you have any preference regarding the contents of the RSS feed? I'm thinking about adding the full content of the post to the feed (currently I just use the summary/description), but I'm not sure if it's a good idea. What do you think?

## Recent Blog Enhancements

* Fresh updates, including the blog's footer!
* Discover every post with the new [Archives][6] page.
* "Now" page fans[^1], find a direct link in the footer [/now][7]
* I've fixed [/linklog][8] page, which was broken due to the fact that I've changed the way I'm using tags (migration from Pocket to Readwise Reader), plus [IFTTT][9] decreased the number of free applets, so I had to change the way I'm using it[^2]
* If you're a Google crawler, you can find the right stuff in `sitemap.xml` you should be able to spend your budget better now! No need to thank me!

## I feel free

* Post-[Bullets #7][1], I've embraced the freedom of unemployment.
* Diving into various ventures keeps each day diverse and fulfilling.
* While it has its challenges like disrupted routines, focusing on hobbies and side projects doesn't feel like a waste of time!
* I'm doing a lot of things, each day is different, I learn new things (outside of IT, mostly).

## Home automation

* [Shelly][10] devices integrated with Homebridge running on my Synology proved to be an excellent choice.
* I was reluctant to buy cover/roller/shutter controller, but when I bought and tested one, I didn't hesitate to buy more for all the windows in the house!
* A cautionary tale – my first ever electric shock from 230V AC taught me a painful but valuable lesson. I've turned off the fuse, but it was not the right one. I'm more careful now[^3]!

## Music and reading

* Inspired by [kottke.org blog][11], for the last few days, the only thing I'm listening to is one of the Ministry of Sound compilations, e.g [The Annual 2021 - Mixed by Pete Tong (DJ Mix)][12] or the one mentioned by kottke. Perfecto!
* During polishing, sanding and other #woodworking activities I'm listening to the audiobook

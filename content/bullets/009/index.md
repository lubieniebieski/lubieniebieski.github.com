Welcome to Bullets #9! You can read the previous one here: [bullets/8][1].

## The Double-Edged Sword of Focus

* Sometimes I wonder if my relentless focus is a strength or a stubborn quirk. Once I've zeroed in on a task, I'm locked in --— nothing else exists until I've seen it through to the end.
* This intense concentration can be a double-edged sword. On one side, it's a source of frustration; it grinds against my ability to switch tasks smoothly. I find myself wrestling with the urge to pause and catch my breath.
* Flip the coin, and it's my superpower. The very same drive ensures I see projects to completion, often with results I'm proud of. It's the reason I've been quiet on Mastodon and here these past weeks.
* While I'm still navigating unemployment, my days have been fully consumed by the Advent of Code, delving into woodworking, and immersing myself in Christmas preparations. It's not silence, but a vibrant dedication humming away from public view.

## Advent of Code

* Eleven days of coding yielded 21 stars, posted for all on [GitHub][2].
* I enjoyed it a lot and plan to finish the rest of the puzzles in the next few weeks[^1].
* It was both enlightening and obsessive, leading me to temper my involvement for the sake of harmony at home.
* ⚠️ Realizing that others, like [Robb][3], [Lewis][4], and [Zoe][5], also stepped back at the same time was an eye-opener.
Zoe's post [Advent of Code is not healthy for me][6] echoed my sentiments exactly, something I didn't realise until I read it.
  * I feel grateful for this post and I'm glad not only that I'm not alone in this, but also that I'm not the only one who decided to step back. 🙏

## Woodworking

* Furniture for my bedroom is 92% done!
* I'm so happy with the results, and the things I've learned along the way.

* It's MDF, so don't expect fancy stuff in here, I'm not that good yet :D
* It was fun project, because I've never done anything like this before and went through all the steps from designing, ordering materials, buying hinges, screws, cutting, drilling and assembling.
* There will be a mirror on the left side of the TV plus some LED lights soon.
* I've also made a few cutting boards for my family and I'm also pretty happy with the results! Aren't they pretty?

## Mountains

* A trip to [Śnieżka][7] (1602 m) and a stay at the mountain shelter [Samotnia][8] were nearly perfect—only a fireplace was missed.
The company, weather, and vistas painted the ideal pre-Christmas escape.
The photographs here barely do justice to the experience.

## Other

* Kudos to Bobiko for launching a new version of [Bobiko.Blog][9]!
* The GTA VI teaser has me eagerly awaiting its release!
* I'm still reading "The wheel of time" and I'm surprised by the number of threads that are still open!
* This story about time made me smile [Did the SS Warrimoo Exist in Two Centuries at Once? | Snopes.com][10][^2]
* And although unemployment brings its challenges, it has opened a season of creativity and anticipation.

Wishing you all a Merry Christmas and a wonderful New Year! 🎄

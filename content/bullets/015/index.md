Welcome to Bullets #15! Sit back, relax, and dive into the latest edition of the [series][2], you can also catch up on the previous edition [bullets/14][1].

It's June already! Last year I did monthly summaries, but this year I have bullets, so I'll try to keep it short and sweet!

## Still running

üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I'm still on the run! I've already covered a distance of over 300km this year and I'm nearing the 400km mark! Here's an interesting fact - this is more than the total distance I ran in the past five years combined. üí™üèª Additionally, I successfully completed a training session where I ran a half-marathon distance, so I've achieved my goal ‚úÖ. I'm feeling content and satisfied!

## Cycling

ü©∑ May is the month of the Giro, and this year Tadej Pogacar made his debut and finished first! I had a great time watching over 150 cyclists race almost every day for nearly three weeks. Now, my sons understand the significance of the pink jersey, and they're really getting into all the cycling slang and themes. It's so much fun when we ride together, and they pretend to be "chasing the attackers" or "closing the gap" while tackling a 3% hill. These are such enjoyable moments!

## Around the house

üóúÔ∏è Tidying up the garage and garden shed can feel like a never-ending task.

However, I recently came up with a brilliant solution. I realized that I could use the leftover scraps of wood from my projects to construct shelves and storage units. This not only allows me to get rid of the excess scraps, but also helps me become more organized. It's truly a win-win situation! I can't believe I didn't think of it sooner. The outcome is that I now have more space to store my tools and materials, and I can easily see what I have at a glance. Admittedly, it may not look the most aesthetically pleasing, but until I become a YouTube sensation, showcasing my DIY projects, it's more than sufficient for my needs.

## Day One meets Logseq

üìù I have been using Day One for almost a decade, and over the years, I have accumulated a substantial collection of memories on the platform. Additionally, I utilize Logseq as a personal knowledge management system to keep all my important notes easily accessible. These notes are conveniently stored on my disk in markdown format.

To ensure that all my memories are consolidated in one place, I wrote a script that allows me to import my Day One export file into Logseq. I import the entries as daily notes, and they are displayed in the daily view. If there is any specific information or reference that is not available in Day One, I add it in Logseq. This way, I can have all my memories centralized while also enhancing them with additional information and links.

This system works exceptionally well for connecting information about people and projects. It enables me to visualize the connections between them and understand the context in which they were created. Currently, I do not import any photos into Logseq since they are not as crucial within the Logseq framework. However, each link from Logseq to Day One includes a reference to the corresponding photo.

The only drawback is that I need to manually run the export from Day One because there is no API available for that functionality. Hopefully, Day One will implement an API in the future. One Day, right? :)

## Reading

‚è±Ô∏è I'm currently reading the 9th book in the "Wheel of Time" series, and I feel compelled to finish the remaining books in the coming months. The storyline is as intricate as the length of the series suggests, but I still find it highly enjoyable. However, I must admit that I'm starting to grow weary of the overly detailed descriptions of the women's attire and jewelry. There seems to be something off in that aspect.

## I no longer have a drone

üí• I crashed it, had it replaced, and then sold it. After experiencing a third collision caused by an obstacle on the side of the drone while flying left or right, I made the decision that I would only buy a drone equipped with omnidirectional obstacle detection, or I would not fly at all. At present, I am without a drone, but if there is a promotion for the DJI Mini 4 Pro, I will likely pull the trigger.

## Trip to B≈Çƒôdne Ska≈Çy

We had a wonderful time visiting B≈Çƒôdne Ska≈Çy[^1] with our dear friends. The children played together, the weather was pleasant, and we savored delicious food, desserts, and sweets. It was a delightful experience spent together!

## Last weeks on social media

I wasn't very active last weeks on Mastodon, that's what worries me a bit, but I managed to see that some other people also had a break recently, so I'm not alone. I hope to get back to it soon! But to be honest, for me it works best as a platform for discovering new personal blogs and interacting with people who share their thoughts and experiences. Either I'm too old for this or I'm just not a social media person. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Maybe that's why I keep writing some posts here from time to time!

Anyway, have a great time!

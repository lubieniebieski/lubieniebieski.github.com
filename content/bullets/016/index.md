🇵🇱🚴🏻‍♀️ Kasia Niewiadoma, a Polish professional cyclist, has just won the Tour de France Femmes 2024! 🚴‍♀️🇵🇱 After an unlucky start during the Olympics, she took the yellow jersey and won in the General Classification (GC) after 8 stages! I'm very proud of her achievement and her win brought good emotions to our entire family. 🥹
It's been a good cycling season, with Tadej won both Giro and Tour, and now Kasia winning her first TdF!

👌 In general, I'm doing great! I've had a lot on my plate, with my sons at home all the time because vacation started, my woodworking projects getting serious, beautiful weather, and having some amazing people around me whom I try to meet, text, or call as often as possible. In short, life is good! It would probably be good if I posted more on social media so it's easier to interact with others. I will (someday!) 🙈 For now, I'm glad to visit your RSS readers!

🪵 I've comissioned a few constructions for my friend (thanks for trusting me!). It has been (and still is) a tough project, but it turned out almost like the visualisation I made:) Even the slide works as expected!

🏃🏻‍♂️ I have run 500+ km this year! I'm super stoked about this, although I had to interrupt my running streak due to some nasty flies in my area... I mean -- look at this:

But I'm back on track, I even bought the entry-level Garmin watch to coach me a bit in the preparation for my first half-marathon in October. I'm excited!

## Quick recap of the last few weeks

🏅 The Olympic games are over. It was a blast to watch so many sports, especially with my little ones! I loved the fact that for 3 weeks, I was able to turn on the TV and watch random sports that I sometimes knew nothing about. I would like my children to have a lot of passion and respect for sports and all the athletes in all the sports, coming from all different nationalities. Even though I'm mostly a football fan, I like to watch and cheer for other athletes. I don't want my kids to only watch one football team and keep saying that they are the best and other teams suck – that's not what sports is/should be about.

📚 I'm going through the last piece from the Wheel of Time series, it's the 14th one! Finally, the "Last Battle" takes place, and the entire story concludes! I started reading the series in 2023, and it took me about 9 months to finish! I'm not sure I would recommend it to anyone, but for me, it was a blast! Especially the last three books, written by Brandon Sanderson who continued to write the story after the "original" author -– Robert Jordan –- passed away.

✈️ We went to an aviation event, where we could see a lot of planes, helicopters, and other flying machines. I was skeptical about it at first, as there were tons of people, and we had to walk 5km to get to the place... but it was worth it! My kids loved it, especially the F-16s and the Hercules C-130. What a day! I regret not having a better camera and lens with me, but I managed to take a few shots with my phone, and what's more important -– I was able to enjoy the moment with my family!

It's the better part of the year now in my part of the world. I hope you're doing well and able to enjoy the summer! 🌞

Welcome to Bullets #4! You can read the previous one here: [bullets/3][1].

## Pro Cycling

- 🇫🇷 The Tour de France 2023 is underway with nine stages completed. My favorite cyclist is currently 17 seconds behind in the GC[^1]. I watch every stage and even my children know the teams, riders, peloton, and breakaways. Proud father moment!
- 🤨 I can't help but feel a bit[^2] jealous when I see others like Jakub making the most of their time on the bike [Co zwróciło moją uwagę w czerwcu 2023 - Bobiko ▪ Blog][2]. Their inspiring posts serve as motivation for me, and I hope to share similar experiences in the future.
- ⛔️ Unfortunately, I'm spending more time not riding than actually on the bike at the moment.

## No cycling

- 🆕 I planned to do a `#newbikeday` post recently, I was very close to do that, but the reality is that I'm still waiting for my new bike.
- 🙅🏻‍♂️ New one arrived, with [Rowermistrz's][3] help I was able to change wheels from Shimano to SRAM system, I've mounted the pedals, the seat, added the bottle cages, added the bike computer mount. I was ready to ride, put 20km ride and I was experiencing some pain. After a few days, I went for a bike fitting session and even though we tried, we weren't able to find a good position for me on this bike. So... I've ordered a bigger model and in the meantime, I have to revert all the changes I've made to the bike. Not a big deal, but still, I'm not riding, and the previous bike is in pieces in my garage.

## Terrace

- 🛠️ This is the biggest refactoring of recent weeks -- equipped with new tools, I'm ripping off the old layer of oil and damaged wood! I estimated it for a few sessions after work, but of course it's taking longer.
- 💪 I've made some early progress even though my children says I look like Bear Grylls during the process!

- ❤️‍🩹 But my tool broke down, I pushed too hard 😂
  {{< image src="202307_IMG_5889-lubieniebieskipl.jpg">}}
- 🩹 Unfortunately, I've made a mistake and I accidentally injured myself with the angle grinder. I'm fine, it's _just a finger_ but I had to pause and take some antibiotics 🤷🏻‍♂️

## Other

- 📚 I finished reading [Sooner Safer Happier][4] and found it insightful for improving in the coming weeks. The quote _"Be the best at being better"_ resonated with me.
- 😎 We had a great time at company retreat, it was so nice to see people with legs[^3] and have a proper amount of laughs and fun!
- 🍿 I watched [Extraction (2020) - IMDb][12] and [Extraction II (2023) - IMDb][13] -- I'm a simple man and I enjoyed them!
- I'm also experiencing with [Trakt][5], as I've never used it before, and even though I initially went for [Letterboxd][6], I'm not sure if I'll stick with it. I don't need a social network for movies, I just want to track what I've watched and what I want to watch. Plus, Letterboxd doesn't allow to track TV Shows, and I have to use a separate app for that. I'll see how it goes. Thanks to [Marco][7] for sparking my interest in exploring different platforms.
- 😶‍🌫️ For ChatGPT stuff, I went for [TypingMind — A better UI for ChatGPT][8], which is exactly what it promises to be -- A better UI for ChatGPT. This time, the trigger for me was the invoice for ChatGPT Plus compared with the spending through API. After 3 secs calculation, I decided to go for an API-only approach and found TypingMind. Works great!
- 📸 I'm quite happy with the [drone photos][9] I've made recently!
- 💬 I found an article about blog comments and using Activity Pub for that [Toot toot! Mastodon-powered Blog Comments ⋅ Cassidy James Blaede][10] -- it looks like something I have on my site right now, but without all of the [Webmentions][11] stuff. I'll have to look into it.

[^1]: General Classification, the main ranking in the Tour de France. The rider with the lowest time wins the race.
[^2]: To be honest, QUITE A LOT!!!
[^3]: These days, most of the time we see each other on video calls, so it was nice to see people who are more than just a head and shoulders.

## The darker side

🌚 Last Sunday, we adjusted our clocks in Poland by an hour to gain more sleep (well, there are potentially other reasons we do that, but let's not get into that here). Initially, it seemed like a good idea; the children were ready for school on time the following Monday. They didn't complain, and everything went smoothly. However, when I went for a run after my second coffee that day, I discovered that it was already dark outside. In short, I'm not a big fan of changing our clocks twice a year, and I hope our country will eventually stop doing this.

## The brighter side(s)

🏃🏻‍♂️ I completed [my first half-marathon](https://www.strava.com/activities/12758187033/overview) with a sub-2-hour result! I'm incredibly happy, even though I was surprised by the lack of energy in my legs in the last few kilometers. This event marked one of my biggest goals for this year, and I'm thrilled to have achieved it.
  
📝 I'm experimenting with Obsidian! My notes-taking system has been struggling lately, so I'm hoping that switching to Obsidian will help me improve. One positive outcome is that I drafted this post in Obsidian, and you're reading it right now on my blog. It's a nice side effect! Now, I just need to figure out how to use Obsidian effectively, establish a daily, weekly, or monthly notes routine, and so on. I believe it should be relatively straightforward. If you read this and use Obsidian yourself, please share your favorite resources with me. Perhaps you've developed a workflow that you're happy with, or maybe you know someone who's worth following. Any information that could enhance my journey with Obsidian would be greatly appreciated🙏

🪑 I'm also making progress in furniture making. One of my most enjoyable commissions was the office desk made from plywood. Instead of simply cutting a tabletop out of a large plywood sheet, I decided to cut around 40 thin pieces, glue them together, and create something unique.

🤔 I'm not active on social media, and I'm not entirely sure about my feelings towards it. I feel like I'm in a good place with my life right now. However, I need to return to work, and my digital footprint in my area of expertise is quite limited at the moment. I'm not sure how this will impact my job search and potential recruitment process. I'll have to wait and see how it unfolds.

🍏 On a brighter note, Apple recently released new Mac Minis, and I must admit, I'm captivated by their compact yet powerful design!

🧐 In the software realm, I recently discovered that [Omnivore is joining ElevenLabs](https://blog.omnivore.app/p/omnivore-is-joining-elevenlabs). I'm not sure whether this is a positive or negative development, especially considering I've found a comfortable rhythm with my DCCF (Digital Content Consumption Flow) using NetNewsWire and Omnivore. We'll see how this change affects my workflow.

📖 In the meantime, I encourage you to read my friend Michał's insightful article  [You May Need a Gap Year - Five Reflections](https://read.perspectiveship.com/p/post-gap-year). After reading this, I realized that my current unemployment situation might have a more sophisticated name, definitely 😅

I miss you all, wonderful people! <3 I hope you're all doing fantastic!

PS: I'm also glad that the Hugo theme I'm using is back in the development stage! Fingers crossed for https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal and Radek the author! Such updates are pushing me to tweak and play with blog a bit more, and I'm excited about it!

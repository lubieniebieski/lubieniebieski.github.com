Welcome to Bullets #10! You can read the previous one here: [bullets/9][1].

I'm thrilled to share first post of 2024 and at the same time -- the 10th edition of Bullets with you! I'm glad this format "clicked" for me. While I considered being more active on Mastodon, it turns out that writing on my own website offers me more joy ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

## 2024: Year of the Blog

* Inspired by Pawe≈Ç's [post][2] discovery, I stumbled upon the prediction that 2024 will be the Year of the Blog, and I wholeheartedly agree [2024 is the Year of the Blog][3].
* Recent shifts in the digital landscape show more individuals favoring personal websites and embracing RSS. My perspective might be somewhat bubble-bound, but it's encouraging.
* Mastodon, despite my affection for it, presents a challenge to keep up with content flow‚Äîsurprising even for someone with my free schedule.
* Reading longer (and more thoughtful) blog posts has become my primary mode of social interaction. The best combination for me is a blog post with a Mastodon thread for discussion üôå.

## The Generalist's Dilemma

* I never been an expert in anything, but I've managed to learn a lot of things in my life and I'm pretty good at a few of them.
* Right now I'm torn between a few different topics:
  * Programming, ever the engineer
  * Parenting, with its unexpected lessons
  * Reconnecting with friends and family
  * Crafting a business concept
  * Woodworking and DIY projects, from novice to practiced amateur
  * Cycling for unmatched joy
  * Photography, a persistent love
* The challenge isn't just finding time --- **it's excelling in these diverse fields**, as I strive to do things well.
* I'm keen to share these thoughts; perhaps they'll resonate with you and help me strategize a fulfilling balance.
* My latest bet is to spend more time on the things that bring me the most joy.

## How to become an optimist

* I don't have an answer to this question, but I'm trying to find one.
* For yeeeeeears I was an optimist, but in last few years I've become more and more pessi... realistic.
* It hit me when I was taking a shower on the 1st of January, and I've heard a song "Always look on the bright side of life" by Monty Python.
* So, I've decided to try to become an optimist again --- suggestions are most welcome! üôÉ

## Other

* "[Wheel of Time][4]" series continues to captivate me into the third book.
* I'm learning Fusion 360 and I'm planning to build a few things using it. I love the rendering capabilities of this software (finally something that puts stress on my Mac!), and the way it works!
* Cycling has made a grand comeback in my life, with over 100km clocked this week!
* DIY pondering led me to choose mitre joints and dowels for a shelving project‚Äîjust awaiting warmer weather for a garage workshop return.
* My feed is brimming with 2023 summaries, they inspire me a lot (and of course lead to opening more and more threads in my already fullfiled brain:D)
* Thanks to [Bobiko][5], I have a music recommendation for you: [Paul Kalkbrenner in Istanbul 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQ1PsLirKX0)!
* I'm bulding Aston Martin DB5 from Lego and it's so much fun! My 7-year old son built it some time ago and it was even featured in [Bullets #6][7], but it was only a borrowed model. Now I have my own and it's going to be a great addition to a shelf in my office!

Warm wishes for 2024‚Äîmay it be a year of discovery and contentment for us all! Do you have any themes for the year ahead? Let me know!

At work, I have to spend a lot of times in meetings, listen to people, analyze input and make educated decisions based on that. After work I still like to code from time to time, keep my family relevant in the online environment. And here is a list of tools that help me to survive almost everyday:

## Notes, writing

- [Craft](https://craft.io/)]: note-taking / PKM / journaling. Powerful search, build in assistant and it's [optimized for Mac](https://www.craft.do/maccatalyst-guide)] -- my favorite example of how the app should "feel".
- [Mindnode](https://mindnode.com/): mind-mapping software for Mac, iPhone, and iPad. I start a lot of my projects and thoughts with this app and then move to Craft or another place to continue.
- [Notability](https://notability.com/): note taking/sketching/drawing app for iPad. I use it to take notes during meetings, draw diagrams, etc. It's a great tool for that.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): my code editor of choice. I'm not that actively writing code these days, but I still use it for some projects. I've tried a lot of editors, but this one is the best for me. Still in love with Vim, though (it's a shame that muscle memory vanished after long break).
- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/): An open source virtual hand-drawn style whiteboard tool for sketching diagrams that have a hand-drawn feel to them.
- [DayOne](https://dayoneapp.com/): Journaling app. I use it to keep track of my daily activities, thoughts, and other crazy things I've done during the day.

## Productivity

- [Raycast](https://raycast.com/): `CMD+SPACE` is my favorite shortcut. This is how I communicate with my computer: browsing through meetings, converting currencies, searching for files, translating words, ... and many many more!
- [Arc Browser](https://thebrowser.company/): nicest UX for browsing the web. Absolutely love it.
- [MeetingBar](https://github.com/leits/MeetingBar): very fast access to my calendar and upcoming meetings. One shortcut away from joining the meeting.
- [CleanShotX](https://cleanshot.com/): Taking screenshots was never so easy and satisfying (UX!).
- [1Password](https://1password.com/): passwords at work, at home, just use it!
- [Carbon Copy Cloner](https://bombich.com/): Backing up my system. Used to use Time Machine, but it's weren't reliable with NAS.
- [Owly](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/owly-prevent-display-sleep/id882812218?mt=12): preventing display sleep.
- [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/): helps you tidy up your menu bar. It allows you to hide icons you don't need, rearrange them, and easily access them when you need them.
- [Clipy](https://github.com/Clipy/Clipy): Clipy is a clipboard manager -- it allows you to save multiple items to the clipboard, so you can quickly and easily access them anytime
- [Things3](https://culturedcode.com/things/): collecting tasks, organizing them, and getting things done.
- [iStat Menus](https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/): iStat Menus is a system monitor for Mac that helps you track how your system is performing. It provides an easy way to keep an eye on your CPU, memory, storage, and network usage.

## Social

- [Ivory](https://tapbots.com/ivory/): app I'm using to explore [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse), mostly Mastodon.

## Knowledge

- [Reeder](https://reederapp.com/): RSS reader for Mac and iOS. I use it to keep up with the latest news in the tech industry.
- [Overcast](https://overcast.fm): My favorite podcast app for iOS. It's simple, fast, and has a lot of features. I use it to listen to podcasts while driving, working out, etc. Smart speed FTW!

## Fun

- [Apple Music](https://www.apple.com/music/): Not very social like Spotify, but it gets the job done.
- [Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html): I like to take photos from time to time and it's hard for me to imagine my life without editing them before the are added to my photo library.

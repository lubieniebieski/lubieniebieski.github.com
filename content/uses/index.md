At work, I have to spend a lot of times in meetings, listen to people, analyze input and make educated decisions based on that. After work I still like to code from time to time, keep my family relevant in the online environment. And here is a list of tools that help me to survive almost everyday:

## Notes, writing

- [Craft](https://craft.io/): note-taking app for Mac that helps you organize your ideas and projects. Powerful search, build in assistant and it's [optimized for Mac](https://www.craft.do/maccatalyst-guide) -- my favorite example of how the app should "feel".
  - I've experimented with a lot of tools in that area, went through Notes.app, Drafts, Ulysses, Bear, plain markdown files, Obsidian, etc. My workflow is very simple right now.
- [Mindnode](https://mindnode.com/): mind-mapping software for Mac, iPhone, and iPad. I start a lot of my projects and thoughts with this app and then move to Craft or another place to continue.
- [Notability](https://notability.com/): note taking/sketching/drawing app for iPad. I use it to take notes during meetings, draw diagrams, etc. It's a great tool for that.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): my code editor of choice. I'm not that actively writing code these days, but I still use it for some projects. I've tried a lot of editors, but this one is the best for me. Still in love with Vim, though (it's a shame that muscle memory vanished after long break).
- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/): An open source virtual hand-drawn style whiteboard tool for sketching diagrams that have a hand-drawn feel to them.

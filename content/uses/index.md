## Software

At work, I have to spend a lot of times in meetings, listen to people, analyze input and make educated decisions based on that. After work I still like to code from time to time, keep my family relevant in the online environment. And here is a list of tools that help me to survive almost everyday:

### Notes, writing

- [Craft][1]: note-taking / PKM / journaling. Powerful search, build in assistant and it's [optimized for Mac][2] -- my favorite example of how the app should "feel".
- [Mindnode][3]: mind-mapping software for Mac, iPhone, and iPad. I start a lot of my projects and thoughts with this app and then move to Craft or another place to continue.
- [Notability][4]: note taking/sketching/drawing app for iPad. I use it to take notes during meetings, draw diagrams, etc. It's a great tool for that.
- [Visual Studio Code][5]: my code editor of choice. I'm not that actively writing code these days, but I still use it for some projects. I've tried a lot of editors, but this one is the best for me. Still in love with Vim, though (it's a shame that muscle memory vanished after long break).
- [Excalidraw][6]: An open source virtual hand-drawn style whiteboard tool for sketching diagrams that have a hand-drawn feel to them.
- [DayOne][7]: Journaling app. I use it to keep track of my daily activities, thoughts, and other crazy things I've done during the day.

### Productivity

- [Raycast][8]: `CMD + SPACE` is my favorite shortcut. This is how I communicate with my computer: browsing through meetings, converting currencies, searching for files, translating words, ... and many many more!
- [Arc Browser][9]: nicest UX for browsing the web. Absolutely love it.
- [MeetingBar][10]: very fast access to my calendar and upcoming meetings. One shortcut away from joining the meeting.
- [CleanShotX][11]: Taking screenshots was never so easy and satisfying (UX!).
- [1Password][12]: passwords at work, at home, just use it!
- [Carbon Copy Cloner][13]: Backing up my system. Used to use Time Machine, but it's weren't reliable with NAS.
- [Owly][14]: preventing display sleep.
- [Bartender][15]: helps you tidy up your menu bar. It allows you to hide icons you don't need, rearrange them, and easily access them when you need them.
- [Clipy][16]: Clipy is a clipboard manager -- it allows you to save multiple items to the clipboard, so you can quickly and easily access them anytime
- [Things3][17]: collecting tasks, organizing them, and getting things done.
- [iStat Menus][18]: iStat Menus is a system monitor for Mac that helps you track how your system is performing. It provides an easy way to keep an eye on your CPU, memory, storage, and network usage.

### Social

- [Ivory][19]: app I'm using to explore [Fediverse][20], mostly Mastodon.

### Knowledge

- [Reeder][21]: RSS reader for Mac and iOS. I use it to keep up with the latest news in the tech industry.
- [Overcast][22]: My favorite podcast app for iOS. It's simple, fast, and has a lot of features. I use it to listen to podcasts while driving, working out, etc. Smart speed FTW!

### Fun

- [Apple Music][23]: Not very social like Spotify, but it gets the job done.
- [Lightroom][24]: I like to take photos from time to time and it's hard for me to imagine my life without editing them before the are added to my photo library.
